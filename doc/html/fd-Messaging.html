<p />
The <em>Messages</em> application provides the user interface to Messaging in Qtopia. 
It provides the facility to receive emails from multiple mail servers as well as <a href="fd-SMS.html" class="twikiLink">SMS</a> and <a href="fd-MMS.html" class="twikiLink">MMS</a> messages from other mobile phone devices. It also allows emails, MMS or SMS messages to be sent to multiple people with or without attachments. SMS messages are sent and received via the GSM cellular network with MMS and e-mail sent and received via TCP/IP based networks, usually <a href="fd-GPRS.html" class="twikiLink">GPRS</a> on a mobile phone. MMS messages are sent and received over the standard HTTP protocol. It is possible to send a single message with both SMS and email addresses. 
Most messages conforming to RFC2822 and RFC2045-RFC2049 are supported and POP or IMAP authentication of messages is provided. Application dependencies include, messaging storage space of approximately 1.5 times the server mailbox size is required on a device and services of an image viewer are required for viewing image attachments.
