<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Qtopia 4.2 supports the BlueZ Bluetooth framework (Version 3.7). It consists of several daemons and tools that allow the system to manipulate local Bluetooth devices and discover remote devices and services.</p>
<p>BlueZ libraries and daemons must be installed and running prior to Qtopia startup as Qtopia relies on information provided by the daemons to detect local host adapters and services.</p>
<p>BlueZ consists of three main daemons as follows:</p>
<p><table align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0">
<thead><tr valign="top" class="qt-style"><th>Daemon</th><th>Desciption</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td><tt>hcid</tt></td><td><ul>
<li>maintains the local Bluetooth host adapter</li>
<li>initiates remote device discovery</li>
<li>handles all aspects of the Bluetooth security and authentication mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td><tt>sdpd</tt></td><td><ul>
<li>maintains a database of services supported by the local host</li>
<li>communicates with <tt>sdp</tt> services on remote Bluetooth hosts in order to discover services presence.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td><tt>rfcommd</tt></td><td><ul>
<li>binds RFCOMM Bluetooth connections to a local serial port.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> This daemon is not currently used by Qtopia.</p>
</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p>Each Bluetooth device or local Bluetooth host adapter has an associated Bluetooth address that is stored as a six byte array and is commonly represented as six hexadecimal bytes separated by colons. For example: <tt>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</tt>.</p>
<p>BlueZ and Qtopia support multiple local Bluetooth host adapters, however the most common case is to use a single adapter.</p>
<p>In order to build Qtopia with Bluetooth support enabled, you must pass the following options:</p>
<p><table align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0">
<thead><tr valign="top" class="qt-style"><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td>-bluetooth</td><td>Turns Bluetooth Support on</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td>-dbus</td><td>Bluetooth support requires DBUS. This turns on DBUS support.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td>-dbuspath</td><td><b>This option is optional.</b> If your DBUS installation is not in /usr, this specifies the DBUS installation path.</td></tr>
</table></p>
<a name="integration"></a>
<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>Qtopia Bluetooth currently supports GAP, SDAP and OPP, DUN, Headset and Handsfree profiles. The GAP and SDAP profiles are implemented largely by the BlueZ <tt>hcid</tt> and <tt>sdpd</tt> daemons.</p>
<p>The current BlueZ architecture uses the language-independent DBUS layer to communicate with its clients. Qtopia uses the Qt DBUS bindings to communicate with the BlueZ <tt>hcid</tt> daemon. Most notifications from the <tt>hcid</tt> daemon are exposed through the <a href="qbluetoothlocaldevice.html">QBluetoothLocalDevice</a> API.</p>
<p>Qtopia also communicates with the BlueZ <tt>sdpd</tt> daemon by using the <tt>sdptool</tt> utility. Qtopia compiles its own custom version of this tool.</p>
<a name="functionality"></a>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<a name="device-configuration"></a>
<h3>Device Configuration</h3>
<p>The local host adapter can be controlled through the <tt>QBluetoothLocalDevice</tt> class where the adapter can be switched on/off and device visibility can be controlled. Visibility is controlled by two variables:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><tt>page scan</tt> - controls whether remote devices can connect to the local device.</li>
<li><tt>inquiry scan</tt> - controls whether remote devices can discover the local device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This indicates that the <i>discoverable</i> state is controlled by setting the <tt>inquiry scan</tt> appropriately.</p>
<a name="gap"></a>
<h3>GAP</h3>
<p>Qtopia fully supports Bluetooth GAP which handles the discovery and establishment of connections between Bluetooth devices. GAP defines how secure connections are established between two devices by a mechanism referred to as <i>pairing</i> and also defines the basic user interface paradigm that must be used by all Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>Qtopia Bluetooth API allows its clients to discover remote devices and various relevant attributes, such as device name, device manufacturer, Bluetooth protocol version supported, etc. Additionally, establishment of trust relationships by pairing remote devices is also supported.</p>
<p>The functionality used to implement this profile is accessible through the <tt>QBluetoothLocalDevice</tt> class.</p>
<a name="sdap"></a>
<h3>SDAP</h3>
<p>SDAP describes how an application should use the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) to discover services on a remote device. Using the Qtopia Bluetooth API, clients can enable any application to discover services running on a remote device.</p>
<p>Two discovery modes are supported:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>searching - searching for a specific service or services</li>
<li>browsing - searching for any services accessible from the public browse group.</li>
</ol>
<a name="object-push-profile-opp"></a>
<h3>Object Push Profile (OPP)</h3>
<p>Qtopia fully supports the Bluetooth Object Push Profile in both client and server modes. This functionality can be found in the <a href="qobexpushclient.html">QObexPushClient</a> and <a href="qobexpushservice.html">QObexPushService</a> classes respectively. Qtopia depends on the 3rdparty OpenOBEX library for all OBEX services, including OPP.</p>
<p>The user can send and receive files over Bluetooth. If a file is received, the user can monitor the progress of the file transfer, and choose to accept or discard the file received. If a business card is received, the user has the option of saving it in his or her address book or discarding.</p>
<p>The user should also see the BluetoothPush service documentation.</p>
<a name="dial-up-networking-profile-dun"></a>
<h3>Dial Up Networking Profile (DUN)</h3>
<p>Qtopia supports the Dial-Up Networking profile. Using DUN users can use their Qtopia based Mobile phone to establish a ppp connection to the ISP supported by their provider. The connection is based on the industry standard PPP protocol. Qtopia provides both a service and client implementations of the DUN profile, so Qtopia Phone users can use other phones to establish a DUN connection over Bluetooth as well.</p>
<a name="headset-profile-hsag"></a>
<h3>Headset Profile (HSAG)</h3>
<p>Qtopia provides a reference implementation of the Headset Audio Gateway profile. This profile allows the use of Bluetooth devices that support the Headset (HS) profile by Qtopia based devices. Headset profile is used to provide wireless handsfree audio communication between a headset and a handset.</p>
<p>Qtopia provides only reference support for the Headset Audio Gateway profile, as frequently such support is hardware and device dependent.</p>
<a name="handsfree-profile-hfag"></a>
<h3>Handsfree Profile (HFAG)</h3>
<p>Qtopia provides a reference implementation of the Handsfree Audio Gateway profile (HFAG) This profile allows the user of Bluetooth devices that support the Handsfree (HF) profile by Qtopia based devices. Handsfree profile is frequently found in Bluetooth based car hands-free kits, and also in Bluetooth headsets. Handsfree profile is in principle very similar to the Headset profile, but provides many more capabilities, including direct dialing, last number redial, three-way calling, and other more advanced features.</p>
<p>Qtopia provides only a reference implementation for the the Handsfree Audio Gateway profile. Handsfree profile requires the audio gateway to route all audio to the handsfree device. The profile also requires the audio stream to be able to be switched between several audio devices mid-stream. Such support is frequently device and hardware dependent.</p>
<p>For more details, please see the next section.</p>
<a name="linux-btsco-kernel-module"></a>
<h3>Linux btsco kernel module</h3>
<p>The Handsfree and Headset profiles depend on the Linux btsco kernel module being installed. This module works by creating an ALSA sound card device. The device can then be used by ALSA aware applications. All audio data is then sent over a Bluetooth connection to the remote device.</p>
<p>For more information please see README document in src/3rdparty/patches/btsco</p>
<a name="service-management-framework"></a>
<h3>Service Management Framework</h3>
<p>Qtopia provides a framework for creating and managing Bluetooth services. A Bluetooth service can be created and registered within this framework by subclassing the <a href="qbluetoothabstractservice.html">QBluetoothAbstractService</a> class. The framework allows registered services to be controlled by external sources through IPC messages. For example, Qtopia's Bluetooth Settings application allows end users to enable or disable registered services, and also modify the security settings of registered services.</p>
<p>The service management framework stores various settings for each known service in the <tt>BluetoothServices.conf</tt> configuration file. This configuration file can be modified to provide default settings for registered services. As an example, a default configuration file is provided at <tt>etc/default/Trolltech/BluetoothServices.conf</tt>. This file sets the default security for the OBEX Object Push Service to 0, as Object Push services do not generally require authentication or encryption.</p>
<p>The service management framework is implemented through the service manager in <tt>src/server/bluetoothservicemanager.h</tt> and the service control interface (for external control through IPC) in <tt>/src/libraries/qtopiacomm/bluetooth/bluetoothservicecontroller.h</tt>.</p>
