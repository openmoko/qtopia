<p />
<p />
The <nop>SIM Toolkit allows service providers to develop phone applications without modifying or installing software on the phone with the <nop>SIM toolkit application providing the user-interface for this functionality.
<p />
Qtopia provides only basic <nop>SIM toolkit functionality as the major part of the work to support <nop>SIM Toolkit is in the modem or vendor plug-in. There are no standard AT commands within the GSM specifications for <nop>SIM Toolkit and each modem has its own proprietary commands.
<p />
The SIM Toolkit provides features such as a display menu, display text and single character and string user input. Input may be numeric and the entered text may be echoed or hidden (as for password text). Play Tones are available for applications to use to indicate events such as call waiting, busy signal or errors etc.
<p />
<p />
See <a href="http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_t/ WG3_USIM/TSGT3_30/docs/T3-040071.doc">3GPP TS 11.14</a>

<h2>Features</h2>

</ul><h3><a name="Call_Control_By_SIM">Call Control By SIM</a></h3>
<p>Some SIMs can control the dialing process to change the way things work.<br/>
We need to support this on modems that have it (e.g. Greenphone).
<h3><a name="Icon_Support">Icon Support</a></h3>
<p>Newer versions of the SIM toolkit specification have support for icons.<br/>
Almost every command that can show a text string (menus, display text,<br/>
send sms, setup idle mode text, etc) can now have an icon associated<br/>
with it.  The icon can either be displayed next to the text string, or as<br/>
a replacement for the text string if it is marked as "self-explainatory".

<p>Qtopia 4.2 has API support for reading icons from the SIM, with some support<br/>
for displaying menu icons in <tt>simapp</tt>, but it isn't perfect.  Qtopia 4.3 needs to add<br/>
proper icon display support to <tt>simapp</tt> and the server wherever appropriate.</p>
<h3><a name="Idle_Mode_String_Operator">Idle Mode String (Operator)</a></h3>
<p>The idle mode text string is displayed on the home screen<br/>
whenever <tt>QSimToolkit::command</tt> is emitted with the command type <tt>SetupIdleModeText</tt>.

<p>Actual display also depends on <span class="nobr"><a href="fd-Themes.html">Themes<sup></sup></a></span>.</p>
<h3><a name="Play_Tone">Play Tone</a></h3>
<p>Tones are not currently played in response to <tt>PLAY TONE</tt>. To implement this,<br/>
requires a database of standard tones that can be consulted and configured.<br/>
Other programs require these tones also;  the standard tones that SIM Toolkit<br/>
requires are listed above in the  <b>Features</b> section.

<p>Update: it doesn't make much sense to allow these tones to be configured by the user.<br/>
Systems integrators may want to change the standard tones to local equivalents,<br/>
but there isn't that many alternatives to "dial tone", "busy", etc, and the GSM specs<br/>
are fairly insistent as to the specific tones to use.</p>
<h3><a name="Refresh_Applications">Refresh Applications</a></h3>
<p>As per Features descriptions above, applications are notified of the refresh however at present, Qtopia applications are not required to action the notification, and simply ignore it. The must however do some things - eg. re-read phone book?
<h3><a name="Setup_Event_List">Setup Event List</a></h3>
<p>Setup event list doesn't do anything useful yet.  The server intercepts<br/>
the message from QSimToolkit and then respond to the requested events<br/>
as they occur.  The two main events of interest are <tt>IdleScreen</tt> and<br/>
<tt>UserActivity</tt>, which indicate when the screen is idle, and when the<br/>
user starts performing some activity again.
