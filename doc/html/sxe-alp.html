<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For the purposes of SXE a program is:</p>
<p><i>&quot;a collection of application binaries and scripts which all operate with the same security profile&quot;</i>.</p>
<p>The SXE applies policy rules to each program component. This overcomes the issue presented by sand-boxing, which prevents programs from unauthorized access to system resources and hence, from being able to function.</p>
<a name="service-access-control"></a>
<h2>Service Access Control</h2>
<p>In general programs may access services. For example, a messaging application on a phone sending an SMS or MMS transmission, or requesting a browser window that opens an internet URL. Service access is achieved by sending IPC calls to the Qtopia system, for example via <tt>QCop</tt> messages.</p>
<p>In the current implementation of Qtopiacore these calls are in the form of streamed data sent through a Unix Domain Socket (UDS). Currently the entire graphics subsystem is implemented via a system of <tt>QWSCommands</tt> over this socket, combined with reads/writes to a piece of shared memory.</p>
<p>Because a program requires access to the well known path to the Unix Domain Socket for the <tt>QCop</tt> system in order to send low-level requests to the Qtopia windowing system, it is not practical to use MAC file system rules to control access to services.</p>
<p>Control of access to services involves two important steps: and authorization, defined as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>authentication</b> : positively identify the program which sent the request</li>
<li><b>authorization</b> : apply a policy rule specific to that program and that request</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the terms <b>program</b> and <b>request</b> require definition.</p>
<p>A downloaded application package may be thought of as containing one <b>program</b> such as a game, or an image manager.</p>
<p>That application may however be made up of a number of binaries, scripts and other files. In some cases a single binary may make up the totality of the package but generally the picture is more complex than that.</p>
<p>For example, a game may have a level editor, the main game binary, and a daemon process while the game itself and the level editor may also be thought of separate applications.</p>
<p>The SXE system applies policy rules to each <b>program</b> component by using the <b>program identity</b> or <tt>progId</tt> which applies to all the components of that application.</p>
<p>When a program wants to access functionality available via Qtopia in general it must use the <tt>QWSCommand</tt> system, or send a <tt>QCop</tt> message or otherwise ask for a service. Generally these accesses can be expressed as a string for example in the case of a <tt>QCop</tt> message requesting a wait indicator to be displayed: <tt>QPE/System/notBusy()</tt></p>
<p>Such an access, and the string representing it, is referred to as a <b>request</b>.</p>
<a name="request-processing"></a>
<h2>Request Processing</h2>
<p>Once the SXE has determined the <i>program identity</i> that is the source of the service request the next step is to examine the policy to see if the request will be actioned. If not, the SXE will raise an alert, by showing an alert icon, or by putting a system message in the users email <tt>inbox</tt>, or both. Additional actions may include killing the process/es the program is running as, or disabling it from automatically launching again.</p>
<p>Deleting or uninstalling the application automatically may not be desirable as:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the application is DRM controlled, removal of the rights object may mean the application cannot be accessed by the user without paying for the DRM controlled package again</li>
<li>if the user has created content using the application that content may be inaccessible after uninstalling the application</li>
<li>given that the program is flawed or malicious the SXE system could ask the user to forward the package for analysis:<ul>
<li>to protect the user from for example being unfairly billed by a network provider</li>
<li>to counter further spread or activity of the program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="authentication-and-authorization-procedure"></a>
<h2>Authentication and Authorization Procedure</h2>
<p>The procedure for authentication and authorization is presented in the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Process an incoming message:<ul>
<li>Verify that the message is a valid message</li>
<li>If the transport is untrusted confirming validity requires a Message Authentication Code.</li>
<li>Check if authentication information is included</li>
<li>Un-marshall the message and prepare to process the request</li>
<li>if the request is in an <b>allow</b> whitelist, procedure complete, process request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine the <i>program identity</i> that is sending an incoming message:<ul>
<li>if the message transport is connection oriented the program identity may be cached against the file descriptor or other identifier for the connection.</li>
<li>the program identity can be extracted from authentication information included in the message once validity is confirmed</li>
<li>if the message transport is trusted either a simple shared secret or Unix domain socket ancillary data identification will suffice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply the policy using the program identity:<ul>
<li>look up the list of security profiles awarded to that <tt>progId</tt> in sxe.profiles:</li>
<li>if the request is not in one of those profiles:<ul>
<li>the message is denied and not processed</li>
<li>the program is disabled and prevented from restarting</li>
<li>a mechanism is supplied for the user to undo the disable</li>
<li>alert icon and/or message to users SMS/email <i>Inbox</i></li>
<li>return immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if the message policy code is in one of the profiles the message is processed normally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<a name="program-identification"></a>
<h2>Program Identification</h2>
<p>In the authorization procedure described above it states that the authentication may be done simply if the message transport is trusted.</p>
<p>If the <i>message transport is trusted</i> <b>four</b> assumptions must be fulfilled. The table below lists these assumptions and how, or if, they hold in the Qtopia platform.</p>
<p><table width="100%" align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0">
<thead><tr valign="top" class="qt-style"><th>Assumption</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td>The transport cannot be intercepted for example, as in a <i>man-in-the-middle</i> attack or <i>traffic-sniffing</i> scenario.</td><td>Unix domain socket traffic cannot be sniffed or rewritten on a standard Linux kernel. However, the following can be sniffed/intercepted:<ul>
<li>files</li>
<li>UDP</li>
<li>shared memory</li>
<li>message queues.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td>The transport end-points cannot be spoofed or subjected to a symlink attack.</td><td><ul>
<li>Unix domain socket end-points can be subjected to symlink attack and process identity can be spoofed; but both of these can be prevented using specifically crafted MAC kernel rules.</li>
<li>Files are subject to symlink attacks, and IP endpoints can be spoofed, though TCP will break down since the <tt>syn/ack</tt> will not work.</li>
<li>The kernel will ensure the identifier key for message queues</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td>The transport is reliable and well-behaved as determined by the platforms kernel and/or network stack</td><td><ul>
<li>UDP is not reliable, other transports generally are.</li>
<li>Kernels should be audited and supplied by trusted partners.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td>The client program cannot be compromised for example by an <tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt> attack or by directly accessing the binary image file on disk</td><td><ul>
<li>MAC rules can prevent accesses to the binaries.</li>
<li>If access is prevented the <tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt> attack is not a problem but there may be some cases where a binary needs to be launched by an untrusted program. This seems unlikely but if so, the MAC kernel can be specifically configured to clean the environment passed to <tt>execve</tt></li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Current <tt>QCop</tt> messaging (which is used for almost all service requests in Qtopia) uses Unix Domain Sockets.</p>
<p><b>Summarizing the above table</b></p>
<p>If the assumptions hold - the kernel and MAC controls can be relied upon to prevent a range of security risks - a simple password-based mechanism can be used at connection setup time to authenticate the connection, or Unix Domain Socket ancillary data can be used.</p>
<p>The second option is more complex than the password method, and carries a portability warning. However if the Unix Domain Sockets rights methods are required for passing file handles that method can be used.</p>
<p>In several scenarios where one or two of these assumptions are not valid the password based mechanism can be simply expanded to HMAC-MD5 message authentication.</p>
