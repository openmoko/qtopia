The FreeType Project LICENSE
----------------------------
<p> 2000-Feb-08
<p> Copyright 1996-2000 by
David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
<p> Introduction
============
<p> The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
FreeType Project.
<p> This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
<p> This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
<p> o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
<p> o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
<p> o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
FreeType code. (`credits')
<p> We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
<p> Legal Terms
===========
<p> 0. Definitions
--------------
<p> Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
beta or final release.
<p> `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
engine'.
<p> This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
this license, you must contact us to verify this.
<p> The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
specified below.
<p> 1. No Warranty
--------------
<p> THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
<p> 2. Redistribution
-----------------
<p> This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
herein, subject to the following conditions:
<p> o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
(`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
source files.
<p> o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
<p> These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
to us.
<p> 3. Advertising
--------------
<p> Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
purposes without specific prior written permission.
<p> We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
<p> As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
of this license.
<p> 4. Contacts
