<p />
Bluetooth is a wireless communications protocol which allows short range communication of typically 10 to 100 meters, between  Bluetooth-equipped devices.  The protocol supports authentication, service discovery and various forms of data transfer.  Typically this is used for file transfer, wireless headsets (audio), synchronization, dial-up networking, printing and other capabilities.  The services provided by the Bluetooth device are generally referred to as Profiles.  Qtopia Bluetooth support can be enabled for any device with a Linux BlueZ compatible Bluetooth host adapter.  
<p />

<p />
<h2><a name="Features"></a> Features </h2>
<p />
<h3><a name="GAP"></a> GAP </h3>
<p />
Qtopia fully supports the Bluetooth Generic Access Profile (GAP) which handles discovery and establishment of connections between Bluetooth devices and defines how secure connections can be established between two devices by a mechanism referred to as 'pairing'.  It also defines the basic user-interface paradigm that must be used by all Bluetooth devices. 
<p />
The Qtopia Bluetooth API allows its clients to discover remote devices and various relevant attributes, such as device name, device manufacturer, Bluetooth protocol version supported, etc.  It also supports the establishment of trust relationships by pairing remote devices.
<p />
<h3><a name="SDAP"></a> SDAP </h3>
<p />
SDAP describes how an application should use the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) to discover services on a remote device.  Using the Qtopia Bluetooth API, clients can enable any application to discover services running on a remote device.  
<p />
Two discovery modes are supported: <ol>
<li> searching - to search for a specific service
</li> <li> browsing - to search for any services accessible from the public browse group.  
</li></ol> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Device_Configuration"></a> Device Configuration </h3>
The following device configuration is available: <ol>
<li> switch the Bluetooth adapter on or off for example,  the device may need to be turned off to reduce power consumption.  
</li> <li> control visibility -   visibility is controlled by two variables: <ul>
<li>  <strong><em>page scan</em></strong> - controls whether remote devices can connect to the local device. 
</li> <li> <strong><em>inquiry scan</em></strong> - controls whether remote devices can discover local device. Allowing the user to set the 'discoverable' state by setting the inquiry scan variable.  1 local device name - set to allow the user to identify the device quickly at a later time. 
</li></ul> 
</li></ol> 
<p />
Other attributes can also be viewed by the user, such as the device manufacturer and the Bluetooth protocol version the device supports and the user can scan
for services(profiles) supported by the device.
<p />
<strong>Note:</strong>  The only service currently supported by Qtopia is Object Push.
<p />
<h3><a name="OPP"></a> OPP </h3>
<p />
Object Push Profile supports both client and server modes for applications that use the object push model of interaction.
The client mode is used to initiate an object push request to a remote device.  
<p />
<strong>Note:</strong>  While the standard defines Business Card Pull and Business Card Exchange features, they are optional, and are currently not supported.  If a remote device initiates a Business Card Pull or a Business Card Exchange with the local OPP service, the request will fail and the service returns an object not found response.
<p />
<h3><a name="Sending_and_Receiving_over_Bluet"></a> Sending and Receiving over Bluetooth </h3>
<p />
The user can send and receive files over Bluetooth.  If a file is received, the user can monitor the progress of the file transfer, and choose to accept or discard the file received.  If a business card is received, the user has the option of saving it in the addressbook or discarding.  
<p />
<h3><a name="Dial_up_Networking_DUN"></a><a name="Dial_up_Networking_DUN_"></a> Dial-up Networking (DUN) </h3>
<p />
Dial-up Networking allows the user to connect to the Internet via third party Bluetooth devices (client profile) and Qtopia devices themselves can provide dial-up connections to third party Bluetooth devices (server profile). Essentially requests from the client are forwarded directly to the hardware modem.  Thus no PPP server is running on the server side.
<p />
<h2><a name="Dependencies"></a> Dependencies </h2>
<p />
Bluetooth uses uses services provided by Contacts for: <ul>
<li> Sending a business card over Bluetooth
</li> <li> Adding a received business card to the addressbook.
</li></ul>
