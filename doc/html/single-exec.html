<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Qtopia can be compiled in a number of ways. The two most common ways are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><i>standard</i> compile - which is a fully dynamic build where each application is a separate binary run as a separate process</li>
<li><i>single-exec</i> compile - <tt>qpe</tt> and all the applications are linked together in a single large binary, however applications are run as separate processes.</li>
</ol>
<a name="benefits"></a>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>There are a number of benefits to <i>single-exec</i> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>single large binary, is smaller in size than many separate application binaries</li>
<li>launch times are faster when the libraries are statically linked together with the applications.</li>
</ul>
<a name="explanation"></a>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>The <i>single-exec</i> makes it possible to statically link all libraries to the programs without each application having a copy of all the libraries. Compiling all the applications into a single binary removes the problem of large individual application binaries and each application is run as a separate process to ensure that a single application fault does not bring down the whole system.</p>
<a name="how-it-works"></a>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>When an application is started in <i>single-exec</i>, the server process is forked and the same binary is executed again, with an <tt>argv</tt> list that informs the newly created process what application it should be. This model is very similar to that used by a UNIX tool called <i>busybox</i> which morphs into different programs based on <tt>argv[0]</tt>.</p>
<p>The size benefit of <i>single-exec</i> is derived from static linking. When the linker combines the code, it performs various size optimizations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>removing inline functions that are always included inline</li>
<li>removing redundant or dead code that is not used by any applications</li>
<li>not including symbol tables usually needed for dynamic linking.</li>
<li>no requirement for the code to be position independent code (PIC) which provides additional size and speed advantages.</li>
</ul>
<a name="issues"></a>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>One important thing to be aware of when building <i>single-exec</i> with additional 3rd-party components is that the symbols must not clash with those from other applications. The use of C++ namespaces would be a very good idea to avoid potential problems caused by this.</p>
<a name="building-single-exec"></a>
<h2>Building Single-exec</h2>
<p>To build Qtopia as a <i>single-exec</i> binary:</p>
<ul>
<li>configure and build Qtopia adding <tt>-singleexec</tt> to the options passed to the Qtopia <tt>configure</tt> script.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is that no application binaries or plug-ins will be generated. Instead, the <tt>qpe</tt> binary will be larger but will contain all the code that would have been in the other binaries.</p>
