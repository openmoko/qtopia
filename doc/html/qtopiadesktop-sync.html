<p> <h2> Introduction
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> <h2> Synchronization Architecture and Algorithms
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> Qtopia Desktop contains the algorithms for synchronization for any
plugin.
<p> Qtopia Desktop handles synchronizing multiple plugins working on the
same application data.  So there can be multiple plugins that
synchronize Contacts data such as Qtopia's Contacts and My
Desktop PIM Application's address book.
<p> The sync algorithm remembers the last state of each plugin when it was
last synced. It then uses that information to determine what changes
have occured in each plugin. A master document is created by 
merging those changes. Each plugin is then given a list of changes
that it should apply so that its contents will be same as the
master document.
<p> The diffs are performed at a field level, so a conflict is created if
the user modifies the same field of the same record in multiple
plugins or interfaces. The algorithm used for conflict resolution of
two records depends on what the user has selected in the
Settings->Sync dialog (currently, the user can choose from duplicating
records, or letting the pda or the desktop win).
<p> This algorirthm requires two main methods for each plugin:
<ul>
<li> each plugin to convert it's data to a generic record format defined
by Qtopia Desktop - MergeInterface::data()
<li> each plugin to apply the changes made during merging to itself -
MergeInterface::applyChanges()
</ul>
<p> Currently, the only architecture supported is synchronizing 
that data that needs to be merged together. Future versions will
support plugins that simply wish to transfer a set of files and possibly
do manual operations on those files.
<p> <h3> Data Conversion during Synchronization
</h3>
<a name="2-1"></a><p> Qtopia Desktop requires each plugin to convert it's data between the
plugin's internal representation of its data and a generic way to
define any data. Qtopia Desktop uses MergeML::Record as a generic
storage class for anyone's data.  MergeML::Record stores its data in
an QMap&lt;int, QString&gt;, where the key refers to the type of field in the map.
<p> For the core pims (Contacts, Tasks and <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>), the integer
values used in the QMap&lt;int, QString&gt; have been defined in their PIM
library classes. There are individual record classes for these data
sets, which are Contact, Task and Event, respectively. These classes
provide convenience methods which convert to and from a
QMap&lt;int,QString&gt; . Each class has a toMap() 
method and a constructor that takes the QMap&lt;int,QString&gt; in their 
constructor.
<p> There are static templated methods provided in mergeml.h that help the
developer convert between a lists of QMap&lt;int,QString&gt; and a list of
these PIM classes. They are MergeML::convertToML() and
MergeML::convertFromML(). These templated methods will be helpfull for the
developer when implementing SyncAppInterface::load() and
SyncAppInterface::save().
