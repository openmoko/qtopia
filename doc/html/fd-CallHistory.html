<p />
<strong>Call History</strong> provides a record of calls that have been dialed, received,
or missed on the phone. A single <strong>Call History</strong> record represents a single
phone call and contains the various attributes of the call. The call record
may be further associated with a contact through its phone number in which
case the contact information is utilized when displaying the record.
Up to 50 call records are permitted, the oldest record being discarded when a
new record is created.

<p /> <ul>
<li> if the call record is associated with a contact, the contact name, phone number type and photo, otherwise the literal number of the call.
