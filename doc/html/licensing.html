</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> Qtopia depends on <a href="qt.html">Qt</a>/Embedded. There are two types of third-party software in Qt/Embedded -
<ol type=1>
<li> Software compiled as part of the Qt library itself - <a href=licenses.html>Licenses</a>
<li> Independent packages that may be added to enhance the capabilities of Qt - <a href=3rdparty.html>Licenses</a>
</ol>
<p> <hr>
<p> Qtopia itself also includes software of the following types:
<p> <ol type=1>
<li> Trolltech original software licensed under
a full commercial license to commercial customers
(Commercial Licensed Software).
<li> Trolltech original software licensed under the
GNU General Public License, and additionally under
a full commercial license to commercial customers
(Dual Licensed Software).
<li> Third-party software licensed under the GNU General Public License
(GPL Licensed Software).

<p> If modifications are made to Dual Licensed Software, this may effect
your right to redistribute GPL Licensed Software that links with the
Dual Licensed Software, unless the modifications are made available
under the terms of the GPL.
<p> If modifications are made to GPL Licensed Software, your right to redistribute
that software is under the terms of the GPL.
<p> If modifications are made to LGPL Licensed Software, your right to redistribute

upon redistribution.
<p> A specific example case of Dual Licensed Software is the Media Player. The Media Player
normally links with GPL Licensed Software such as the libmpeg3 plugin, and therefore
if you make modifications
to the Media Player, you must either make those modifications under the
terms of the GPL, or you must not distribute the GPL Licensed Software that
links with the Media Player, such as the libmpeg3 plugin.
