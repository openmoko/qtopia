<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Qtopia 4.3&#x2e;0 release is a feature release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.3 technology. The main purpose of this release is to provide APIs for new functionality so that third party developers and product integrators may begin to write code for Qtopia 4.3&#x2e;x devices.</p>
<p>For the first time, this release of Qtopia makes the source code of the full Qtopia telephony stack available to both commercial and opensource developers under Trolltech's dual licensing model. Previously, this code was only available to commercial customers.</p>
<a name="enhancements"></a>

This release however contains an experimental system wide SXE that allows vendors to control how all applications access system resources and services. allows a vendor to control how applications access system resources and to restrict the set of services that each application can use. SXE also allows downloaded third-party applications to be run in a secure sandbox environment with controlled access to Qtopia resources and services.</li>
<li>The Software Packages application has also been overhauled to improve usability and to provide full integration with SXE.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<p><b>Note</b>: In addition to those items listed below, all bug fixes made to date during the Qtopia 4.2&#x2e;x series (4.2&#x2e;1 to 4.2&#x2e;5) that are relevant for Qtopia 4.3 are included in this release.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Emergency Calls</b><ul>
<li>BUG 179910: In touchscreen mode, emergency calls could not be placed when the device was PIN locked.</li>
<li>BUG 179913: Additional emergency numbers 110, 999, 118 and 119 have been added in accordance with GSM 22.101 standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Input Methods</b><ul>
<li>BUG 177768: The Handwriting Recognition input method was biasing its fuzzy matching towards completed words, causing inaccurate pre-edit text to be displayed when partial words were entered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Media Player</b><ul>
<li>BUG 138734: If the Media Player was backgrounded while a video was playing, the video widget would not hide, instead staying on top of all other windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Messages</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 120160: Messages wasn't starting/stopping network when fetching mail.</li>
<li>BUG 123694: Outgoing messages were saved in Drafts instead of Outbox in Airplane Safe Mode.</li>
<li>BUG 139837: Messages refused to process attachments larger than 2Mb.</li>
<li>BUG 140806: The user was not audibly notified when an MMS message is received.</li>
<li>BUG 176946: Under some circumstances, the Messages application would display the wrong message when a new message was received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Notes</b><ul>
<li>BUG 112391: The Notes application was unable to open large text files. As this application is intended for viewing small text notes, a limit of 256Kb has been imposed, beyond which the application will refuse to open files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Server</b><ul>
<li>BUG 135563: The Softkey Menu did not become scrollable when too big for the screen.</li>

</ol>
<a name="known-issues"></a>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Greenphone</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 171152: Due to a bug in the modem firmware, outgoing calls may not be cancelled correctly if the user presses the hangup key while the call is in the &quot;dialing&quot; state. Qtopia attempts to work around this by attempting to cancel the call after it transitions from &quot;dialing' to &quot;alerting&quot;. This strategy fails in cases where the call transitions directly from &quot;dialing&quot; to &quot;connected&quot;.</li>
<li>BUG 172654: The Greenphone's hardware volume keys do not control the audio volume on the device. This feature was previously working in Qtopa 4.2&#x2e;</li>
<li>BUG 179229: The Greenphone modem does not report whether an incoming call has been diverted from another number. Thus Qtopia is unable to indicate Call Diversion to the user, and the Greenphone therefore fails to achieve GCF Standard Compliance for this function.</li>
<li>BUG 180204: In this release the Greenphone does not play Midi files. This feature was previously working in Qtopia 4.2&#x2e;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Media Player</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 142554: After a call ends, Media Player incorrectly resumes playback of media file if the file was paused when the call was received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Messages</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 142744: MMS audio doesn't play to completion if the audio track is longer than the slideshow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Server Widgets</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 148987: The Task Manager list only works correctly with the Standard Qtopia server widgets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Touchscreen</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 184982: Spinboxes are very hard to control on finger-driven touchscreen due to the small size of the up and down arrow controls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
