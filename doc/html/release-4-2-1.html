<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Qtopia 4.2&#x2e;1 release is a maintenance release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.2 technology. This release provides a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, both general and Greenphone-specific.</p>
<a name="enhancements"></a>
<h2>Enhancements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Bluetooth</b> Bluetooth support is provided in this release only as a technology preview. When building Qtopia, Bluetooth is disabled by default, but may be enabled by specifying the -bluetooth configure switch.<ul>
<li>Bluetooth audio now functions on the Greenphone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Calendar</b><ul>
<li>Google Calendar data can be synced to Qtopia.</li>
<li>Calendar can now be set to show either month or day view by default.</li>
<li>Calendar can now filter events by category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Clock</b><ul>
<li>Date and Time can now be set from the <tt>Clock</tt> application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Look and Feel</b><ul>
<li>A number of widgets have been enhanced to provide a clearer indication of whether the widget is in navigation mode or editing mode. In some cases, transitioning between these modes has also been streamlined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Server</b><ul>
<li>Server Widgets for the Home Screen and Launcher may be replaced with custom widgets. In a standard Qtopia build, a demonstration of this feature can be accessed via the Settings-&gt;Server Widgets application.</li>
<li>Server Tasks provide a more extensible mechanism to control what and how the Qtopia server process starts. System integrators can register blocks of functionality - &quot;tasks&quot; - that the Qtopia server will automatically manage and run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<a name="optimizations"></a>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Build System</b>: Reduced installed Qtopia footprint by avoiding installation of non-scalable images when scalable versions are available.</li>
<li><b>Data Linking</b>: Don't use (relatively expensive) rich text when not necessary.</li>
<li><b>Data Linking</b>: Improved performance of link verification.</li>
<li><b>Launching</b>: <tt>configure</tt> now provides a <tt>-force-quicklaunch</tt> switch to make all applications use the quicklauncher. This option improves launch speed for some applications at the cost of larger binary size.</li>
<li><b>Painting</b>: Improved performance on 16bpp displays by not using 32bpp background brushes and pixmaps.</li>
<li><b>Painting</b>: Improved performance by eliminating several instances of unnecessary painting.</li>
<li><b>PIM</b>: Improved performance of SQL access by moving database initialization to the quicklauncher and caching the most common queries.</li>
</ol>
