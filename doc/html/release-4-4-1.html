<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Qt Extended 4.4&#x2e;1 release (also known as Qtopia 4.4) is a feature release of Qt Extended that is based on Qt 4.4 technology. Note that starting with this release Qtopia has been renamed to Qt Extended. The version numbering remains consistent with previous Qtopia releases.</p>
<p>The purpose of this release is to publish new Qt Extended API's, to allow device integrators to begin work on their projects. This release contains a number of significant quality issues, which will be corrected in future patch releases. Device integrators should not ship this version of Qt Extended on production devices.</p>
<a name="new-features"></a>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Build System</b><ul>
<li>This release introduces a new build tool, <b>qbuild</b>. The qbuild tool replaces qmake, allowing more efficient processing of the build instructions contained in .pro, .pri amd .prl files and better management of dependencies between projects.</li>
<li>Qt Extended no longer supports the previously used concept of Editions. Editions were a shorthand for specifying the type of user-interface to be used and the default set of projects (modules) to be included in a build. The UI type and modules are now specified separately.</li>
<li>Please see the <a href="buildsystem/chlog-4-4-1-1.html">build system changes</a> page for more detailed information on the build system changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Cleanup Wizard</b><ul>
<li>Qt Extended now provides a <b>Cleanup Wizard</b>, which allows the user to delete old messages, calendar events and documents. The Cleanup Wizard will automatically be offered to the user if free storage falls below a level set by the device integrator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Document Management</b><ul>
<li>The Documents list now provides a <b>Rescan System</b> menu option, which causes the content system to rescan all controlled directories for documents and to repopulate the Documents list with this information. This allows the user to update the Documents list if they have changed the filesystem contents outside of Qt Extended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Dynamic Rotation</b><ul>
<li>Qt Extended now supports dynamic rotation of the display. The display can be rotated at runtime by using the Rotation Settings application or in response to hardware events from orientation sensors or slide switches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Fast Load</b><ul>
<li>Qt Extended now supports &quot;fast loading&quot; of selected applications. Applications marked as FastLoad are launched in the background when Qt Extended starts up. When the user chooses a FastLoad application from the launcher the application is brought to the foreground, appearing to launch instantly. The user can select an application for fast loading by choosing <b>FastLoad</b> from the Options menu when the application is highlighted in the launcher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>First Use Wizard</b><ul>
<li>Qt Extended now provides a <b>First Use Wizard</b>, which allows the user to choose the initial Language and Date/Time settings for a device the first time the device is booted.</li>

This feature is configured in the Account Settings dialog, where the user may also configure whether interval checking is disabled while roaming to reduce data download costs.</li>
<li>If composition of a message is aborted by the user pressing the hangup key to return to the homescreen, the Messages application will offer to resume composing the message the next time it is launched.</li>
