<p />
The <strong>Calendar</strong> application allows a user to plan their schedule. This includes the scheduling of timed events such as meetings,
day events such as birthdays, and multi-day events such as workshops. The application also provides the facility to set alarms for events and to specify a pattern of repetition for events.
<p />

<p />
<h2><a name="Data"></a> Data </h2>
<p />
An event consists of the following:
<p /> <ul>
<li> A single line text description.
</li> <li> A single line text location.
</li> <li> A multi-line text note.
</li> <li> A start date and time.
</li> <li> An end date and time.
</li> <li> A timezone for start and end times. This is only available where the event is associated with a timezone.
</li> <li> A pattern of repetition.
</li> <li> An alarm, including if it is audible and how long before the event it should be activated.
</li> <li> One or more categories. If the event is not assigned any category it is categorized as <em>unfiled</em>.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Patterns_of_Repetition"></a> Patterns of Repetition </h3>
<p />
The user is able to set an event to: repeat daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or other. These are standard patterns of repetition and the user is able to create a more complex pattern using the advanced options.
<p />
<h4><a name="Daily"></a> Daily </h4>
<p />
These events happen once each day. In the advanced options the user is able to specify the number of days between each occurrence of the event.
<p />
<h4><a name="Weekly"></a> Weekly </h4>
<p />
These events happen once each week. In the advanced options the user is able to specify how many weeks apart each repeating event should be, as well as specifying that an event occurs on multiple days of a week. The date
of the starting day for an event is always the first day the event will
occur in a week. Therefore an event occurring every four weeks on Wednesday,
Friday, and Monday occurs on the Wednesday, then the Friday of that week and the immediately following Monday, and then does not re-occur until the forth Wednesday following that.
<p />
This is not guaranteed to be maintained when syncing to non-Qtopia devices or software.
<p />
<h4><a name="Monthly"></a> Monthly </h4>
<p />
These events happen once each month on the same day of month as the start event.
In the advanced options the user is able to specify how many months apart each repeating event will occur.
<p />
It is also possible to specify that the event:
<p /> <ul>
<li> Occurs on a specific day of the month. For example, every 2 months on the 18th of the month.
</li> <li> Occurs so many weeks from the start of the month. For example, every 2 months on the 2nd Sunday of the month.
</li> <li> Occurs so many weeks from the end of the month. For example, every 2 months on the last Thursday of the month.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
If a repeated event falls on a day not included in a particular month, the event is skipped for that month.
<p />
<h4><a name="Yearly"></a> Yearly </h4>
<p />
This event happens once each year. In the advanced options the user is able to specify how many years apart each repeating event will occur.
<p />
<h2><a name="Application_Views"></a> Application Views </h2>
<p />
It is possible to view the events in the following ways:
<p /> <ul>
<li> The events for a single day.
</li> <li> The events for a single month.
</li> <li> A detailed view of a single event.
</li> <li> An event opened for editing.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Day_View"></a> Day View </h3>
<p />
This shows the events that occur for a particular date. Repeating events are shown in pale blue and non-repeating events are shown in pale red. All day events are shown at the top of the view.
The view also adjusts the height of hours through the
day to show as much detail of the events for that day as possible.
<p />
The user is able to navigate to other days. The 1 and 3 keys are used to change back and forth by week, the 4 and 6 keys change by month, and the 7 and 9 keys by year.  The 5 key can then be used to navigate to the current day.
<p />
The user is able to edit the general settings such as the default alarm preset and the default day start time.
<p />
The user is able to change to the month view, a detailed view of the current event or add a new event.
<p />
<h3><a name="Month_View"></a> Month View </h3>
<p />
This shows the events that occur for a particular month. Repeating events are shown in blue, non-repeating events in red.
<p />
Each event is represented as a bar giving an approximate indication of when during the day the event occurs. For
multiple events on a single day the bars for those events are merged. All day events are shown by shading the
day pale red for non-repeating events, pale blue for repeating events or a combination of the two colors if both occur on a particular day.
<p />
The user is able to navigate to other days. The 1 and 3 keys are used to change back and forth by week, the 4 and 6 keys change by month, and the 7 and 9 keys by year. The 5 key can then be used to navigate to the current day.
<p />
The user is able to edit the general settings such as the default alarm preset and the default day start time.
<p />
The user is also able to show the details for a particular day or add a new event.
<p />
<h3><a name="Detailed_View"></a> Detailed View </h3>
<p />
The detailed view of an event displays the data for a single event. This is shown as rich text. All the information for the event is shown formatted for optimum readability.
<p />
From the detailed list view the user is able to:
<p /> <ul>
<li> Edit the current event, using the Edit view of the event.
</li> <li> Delete the current event.
</li> <li> Beam the current event via IR.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Edit_View"></a> Edit View </h3>
<p />
The edit view of an event allows the user to specify the data for a new event
or modify that of an existing event.
<p />
Non-applicable values are disabled. For example, the start time entry are disabled if the event is marked as an all day event.
<p />
When the editing has been completed the user is able to either accept or cancel the changes they have made.
