  The <strong>Full-screen Handwriting Input</strong> plug-in allows the user to draw
  characters for text input over the top of dialogs. In addition the plug-in also
  allows the user to customize it to their requirements.

<h2>Features</h2>

</ul><h3><a name="Dictionary_Selection">Dictionary Selection</a></h3>
<p>  The user is able to specify an alternate language to be used for<br/>
  word recognition.
<h3><a name="Input_Hinting">Input Hinting</a></h3>
<p>  <b>Full-screen Handwriting</b> is able to take input hints from text input<br/>
  elements in applications and use the input hint information to improve<br/>
  accuracy in recognizing characters for that text input.
<h3><a name="Input_Mode">Input Mode</a></h3>
<p>  The user is able to specify the type of input apart from that<br/>
  suggested by the text element, and hence modify how the plug-in recognizes<br/>
  drawn characters.
<h3><a name="Next_Word">Next Word</a></h3>
<p>  The user is able change the recognized word to the next most likely<br/>
  word.
<h3><a name="Smart_Activation">Smart Activation</a></h3>
<p>  <b>Full-screen Handwriting</b> is only active when an element that accepts<br/>
  text input has focus. When it is active it:


<ul>
	<li>Passes screen taps through to the underlying application unless they are made immediately following a previous stroke.</li>
	<li>Passes screen strokes through to the underlying application if they are preceded by a pausing movement of the stylus for a short period of time.</li>
</ul>



<p>  <b>Full-screen Handwriting</b> always ignores strokes that are started<br/>
  within the area designated for a scrollbar on the right side of the screen.</p>
<h3><a name="Symbol_Input">Symbol Input</a></h3>
<p>  The user is able to open a pop-up of additional symbols.
<h3><a name="Word_Recognition">Word Recognition</a></h3>
<p>  <b>Full-screen Handwriting</b> prioritizes the recognition of characters as part<br/>
  of its attempts to find a matching word. If a drawn character closely matches two or more characters,<br/>
  then the plug-in biases towards characters that make up complete words.<br/>
  For this reason a set of digits is also considered to be a word.

<p>  If no word is matched, then the plug-in uses the most closely matched<br/>
  characters as they are drawn.</p>

<p>For example, a character drawn on the screen might be either an 'n' or an 'h'<br/>
and even though it might most closely resemble a 'h' the word recognition<br/>
feature waits to determine the character until the second character<br/>
is entered. If the second character is an 'o' then the application<br/>
assumes that the first character was an 'n'. However if a third character<br/>
is added such as 'w' then since the first character more closely resembled<br/>
a 'h' then the recognition feature suggests 'how' and provide 'now' as<br/>
a secondary option.</p>

<p>If characters are added until no word in the dictionary matches, then the<br/>
application reverts to spelling the word with 'h' since it was the most likely letter.</p>

<p>Words consisting of more than two characters that are not in the dictionary are added to the list of recognized words.</p>
<h3><a name="Word_Selection">Word Selection</a></h3>
<p>  The user is able to open a pop-up of all possible matches to<br/>
  the set of characters they have drawn.
