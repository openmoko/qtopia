<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Qtopia 4.3&#x2e;1 release (also known as 4.3 Final) is a feature release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.3 technology. The main purposes of this release are to finalise the 4.3 feature set and to provide bug fixes and performance improvements based on both internal testing and customer feedback received for the 4.3&#x2e;0 (4.3 Beta) release.</p>
<p>This Release Note describes only the changes made between the 4.3&#x2e;0 and 4.3&#x2e;1 releases. Please read the <a href="release-4-3-0.html">Qtopia 4.3&#x2e;0 Release Notes</a> for a list of the changes made prior to the 4.3&#x2e;0 release.</p>
<p>The <a href="buildsystem/chlog-4-3-1-1.html">build system</a> and <a href="qtopiadesktop/chlog-4-3-1-1.html">Qtopia Sync Agent</a> changes are recorded separately.</p>
<a name="enhancements"></a>

<li>BUG 190449: The Email Details dialog had incorrect input hints, making it difficult to enter a valid email address.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Input Methods</b><ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Media Player</b><ul>
<li>BUG 180204: Qtopia did not play Midi files. The Media Player will now play Midi files when Qtopia is built with the &quot;cruxus&quot; mediaengine.</li>
<li>BUG 183946: The Settings dialog was only accessible while a file was playing. It is now accessible from the browser menus too.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Media Server</b><ul>
<li>BUG 142927: Qtopia was unable to play media in a singleexec build.</li>
<li>BUG 172654: Using hardware buttons to adjust audio volume did not work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Messaging</b><ul>
<li>BUG 181674: Performance of MMS loading was poor. This has been improved by delaying some processing until it is needed and avoiding making multiple copies of elements that are used on multiple slides.</li>
<li>BUG 183162: No busy indication was displayed when retrieving a large message, giving the impression that the application had frozen.</li>
<li>BUG 183395: When forwarding an SMS message, the text of the original message was not included.</li>
<li>BUG 183661: When downloading large numbers of messages via IMAP, the performance of the preview phase degenerated significantly as it progressed.</li>
<li>BUG 183788: Message counts were not shown for nested IMAP folders.</li>
<li>BUG 184980: The wrong folder contents could be displayed after switching between identically named folders in the main and Email folder lists.</li>
<li>BUG 185966: The New Message menu presented options that were impossible to complete successfully; New Email was presented when no outgoing email account was configured, and New Multimedia Message was presented when no WAP stack was present.</li>
<li>BUG 186145: The Messages application would suffer a stack overflow crash if a socket error occured during SMTP transmission.</li>
<li>BUG 187624: When synchronizing with an IMAP server, messages that were no longer on the server were not marked as such in the folder display.</li>
<li>BUG 187847: The Messages application did not provide any progress indication when deleting an email account. This would give the user the impression that the application had frozen.</li>
<li>BUG 187851: The Email folder list was not correctly updated when the account name was changed.</li>
<li>BUG 188609: When IMAP folders were removed, the contained messages were not deleted, leaving them orphaned in the message database.</li>
<li>BUG 188923: If a new SMS message arrived while viewing email, an email message would be displayed to the user instead of the new SMS.</li>
<li>BUG 189455: When the user attempted to send an email with a non-conforming address, the message was silently placed into the Drafts folder without presenting an error message to the user.</li>
<li>BUG 189642: Email messages with a signature included failed to send correctly via SMTP.</li>
<li>BUG 189839: In the email account dialog, several fields incorrectly had autocapitalization enabled.</li>
<li>BUG 190450: Incorrect input hints made it difficult to enter valid email addresses when sending an email.</li>
<li>BUG 190489: When fetching IMAP messages, the Messages application incorrectly caused the server's copies of the messages to be marked as read.</li>
<li>BUG 190490: SMTP authentication against an incoming mail server has been made optional. Previously, this was (incorrectly) mandatory.</li>
<li>BUG 190492: When connecting to an IMAP server, the username and password were passed as literal strings instead of quoted strings, causing certain special characters to be handled incorrectly.</li>
<li>BUG 191452: Some customer devices would incorrectly report a &quot;Mail-encoding error&quot; when sending or receiving SMS messages. This was due to shared mmap not working correctly on those devices. The Messages application now avoids this problem by not using shared mmap.</li>
<li>BUG 197898: When downloading messages via POP, the Messages application would incorrectly indicate to the user that a message had been removed from the server by another user if the server UID was a substring of that of another message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Neo 1973 (ficgta01 device profile)</b><ul>
<li>BUG 178077: If the user attempted to lock the screen via the Home Screen's options menu, the keypad lock was activated instead of the touchscreen lock.</li>
<li>BUG 180073: Spinboxes could not be driven due to the small size and close proximity of the up and down arrows. The arrows now appear on opposite sides of the spinbox.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>BUG 191029: If a package's installation was aborted, LIDS rules for the package were not removed.</li>
<li>BUG 191030: Packages could not access their translation files at runtime.</li>
<li>BUG 193250: Packages could not include shared libraries.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Security</b><ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Telephony</b><ul>
<li>BUG 176256: If a call was active and a second call was received, the ringtone would still be played. Rather than playing the ringtone, Qtopia now relies on the phone network to insert a &quot;call waiting&quot; tone into the audio stream to indicate that a second call is being received.</li>
<li>BUG 180319: Failure to set Call Barring options was not reported to the user.</li>
<li>BUG 185619: The SIM PIN entry dialog would time out after two minutes, leaving Qtopia unable to register to a GSM network until restarted.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<a name="known-issues"></a>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Greenphone</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 171152: Due to a bug in the modem firmware, outgoing calls may not be canceled correctly if the user presses the hangup key while the call is in the &quot;dialing&quot; state. Qtopia attempts to work around this by attempting to cancel the call after it transitions from &quot;dialing' to &quot;alerting&quot;. This strategy fails in cases where the call transitions directly from &quot;dialing&quot; to &quot;connected&quot;.</li>
<li>BUG 176936: Due to incorrect factory calibration, some Greenphone handsets do not perform noise cancellation correctly. This may result in significant levels of echo being heard when using the handset indoors. This level of echo can be reduced by adjusting the microphone and speaker volumes via the <b>Call Options</b> application's <b>Call Volume</b> feature.</li>
<li>BUG 179229: The Greenphone modem does not report whether an incoming call has been diverted from another number. Thus Qtopia is unable to indicate Call Diversion to the user, and the Greenphone therefore fails to achieve GCF Standard Compliance for this function.</li>
<li>BUG 180951: On some Greenphones, the Bluetooth subsystem regularly gets into a state where no further Bluetooth operations will succeed until the device is reset. This is believed to be a fault in the hardware and/or kernel, rather than a problem with the Qtopia software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Media Player</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 142554: After a call ends, Media Player incorrectly resumes playback of media file if the file was paused when the call was received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Messages</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 142744: MMS audio doesn't play to completion if the audio track is longer than the slideshow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Neo 1973 (ficgta01 device profile)</b><ul>
<li>BUG 197301: SIM Applications are not supported on the Neo 1973 in this release.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Server Widgets</b>:<ul>
<li>BUG 148987: The Task Manager list only works correctly with the Standard Qtopia server widgets.</li>
</ul>
