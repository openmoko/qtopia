<p />
The <strong>Tasks</strong> application allows the user to prioritize tasks,
manage due dates and, when appropriate, mark tasks as completed.
<p />

<p />
<h2><a name="Data"></a> Data </h2>
<p />
A task consists of the following data:
<p /> <ul>
<li> A single line text description.
</li> <li> A priority ranging from 1 as the highest priority to 5 as the lowest priority.
</li> <li> A multi-line text note.
</li> <li> A status consisting of: <ul>
<li> Not started
</li> <li> In Progress
</li> <li> Completed
</li> <li> Waiting
</li> <li> Deferred
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p /> <ul>
<li> A percentage completed. Not applicable if task status is Not Started or Completed.
</li> <li> The date the task is due for completion. This is optional.
</li> <li> The date the task was started. Not applicable if the task status is Not Started.
</li> <li> The date the task was completed. Only applicable if the task status is Completed.
</li> <li> One or more categories. If the task is not assigned any category it is marked as <em>unfiled</em>.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h2><a name="Application_Views"></a> Application Views </h2>
<p />
It is possible to view tasks in the following three ways:
<p /> <ul>
<li> As a sorted list of tasks.
</li> <li> A detailed view of a single task.
</li> <li> A task opened for editing.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Sorted_List"></a> Sorted List </h3>
<p />
The primary display of the application shows a sorted list of tasks. In this
list a user is able to change the priority of a task, mark a task Completed
or view additional details of the task.
<p />
The sorting order of the tasks is:
<p /> <ul>
<li> Completed: incomplete tasks are shown first.
</li> <li> Priority: tasks with a priority closer to 1 are shown first.
</li> <li> Description: tasks are shown in alphabetic order.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
From the sorted list view the user is able to:
<p /> <ul>
<li> Create a new task through the Edit View of the task.
</li> <li> View the details for the task through the Detailed View of the task.
</li> <li> Mark tasks as completed.
</li> <li> Change the priority of a task
</li> <li> Filter the list of tasks shown according to a specified category.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Detailed_View"></a> Detailed View </h3>
<p />
The detailed view of a task shows data for a single task.  This is shown as
rich text.  All the information for the task is formatted for optimum readability.
<p />
From the sorted list view the user is able to:
<p /> <ul>
<li> Edit the current task through the Edit View of the task.
</li> <li> Delete the current task.
</li> <li> Beam the current task using IR.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="Edit_View"></a> Edit View </h3>
<p />
The edit view of a task allows the user to specify the data for a new task
or modify that of an old task.
<p />
Non-applicable values are disabled. For example, the start date field is disabled if the the task status is marked as Not Started.
<p />
When the editing has been completed the user is able to either accept or cancel the changes they have made.
<p />
