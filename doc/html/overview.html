<p> <h2> Introduction
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> Qtopia is a platform for embedded Linux devices. Qtopia provides the
end-user with a set of core applications that are expected on modern
embedded platforms such as PIM applications (Address Book, <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>
and Todo) and a Media Player.
<p> Qtopia provides the developer with a clean object-oriented API to
write applications for an embedded device. Most of the API presented
to the developer is the same API offered by Trolltech for
cross-platform development between Windows, Mac and the UNIX's. The
same code can be shared and reused on all of these desktop platforms
and now Qtopia is just another platform to run your great <a href="qt.html">Qt</a> applications.
<p> The Qtopia platform encomposses both the software that runs on an
embedded device and the software that runs on a end-users desktop. The
software that runs on the desktop, called Qtopia Desktop, allows the
user to input Qtopia application information on their desktop and
synchronize their data between the embedded device and the
desktop. Qtopia Desktop allows the developer to write plugins into the
desktop to synchronize their information. Please refer to the
<a href="qtopiadesktop.html">Qtopia Desktop documentation</a> for
more information.
<p> For the most up to date documentation and product information for
Qtopia, please visit <a
href=http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia/index.html> Trolltech's
website</a>.
<p> <h2> Software Stack
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> The Qtopia software stack on the embedded device has four main layers
as shown in the following image.
<p> <center><img src="stack.png" width="254" height="291"></center> Insignia's Java is written on top of <a href="qt.html">Qt</a>/Embedded (and a Qt/AWT
implementation). Other applications such as Opera's Web Browser and
Handcom Office Suite is written ontop of Qt/Embedded and Qtopia.
<p> <h2> Qtopia's Qt/Embedded Configuration
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> Trolltech's flagship product, Qt, is an API for cross-platform C++
development. Qt/Embedded allows applications written for the Qt/API to
be recompiled and run for an embedded architecture without a
underlying windowing system such as X11.
<p> It is intended that an application that is written for an embedded
device can use the same code that is used on the desktop. This allows the
developer to have a single source tree for the entire application
suite offering.
<p> In fact, the developer will not see a different API for Qt/Embedded in
the Qt documenation. However, Qtopia uses a subset of Qt/Embedded tuned for
smaller footprint (displays, memory, speed, etc). 
<p> The modules removed from Qt due to their large size, speed or because
they do not belong or are not necessary on an embedded device. For
some of the modules, a description is provided if it is not obvious
why this was left out of the <a href="qt.html">Qt</a>/Embedded offering for Qtopia.
<p> <ul>
<li> Core Qt: <a href=properties.html> properties</a>, <a
href=coordsys.html>transformations</a>, <a
href=qprinter.html>QPrinter</a> , <a href=xml.html> XML
module</a> (too large and too slow to use)
<p> <li> UI: <a href=qtextcodec.html> <a href="qtextcodec.html">QTextCodec</a> modules</a>, <a
href=dnd.html>drag and drop</a>, <a href=emb-fonts.html>free
type fonts</a>, extra desktop styles (i.e. Motif) were replaced by
Qtopia style plugins
<p> <li> Images: No PPM images for <a
href=qimageio.html>QImageIO</a>, <a
href=qpicture.html>QPicture</a>
<p> <li> QWidgets: <a href=qsplitter.html> <a href="qsplitter.html">QSplitter</a></a>, <a
href=qdial.html> <a href="qdial.html">QDial</a></a>, <a
href=qworkspace.html>QWorkspace</a>
<p> <li> QDialogs: <a href=qfiledialog.html> <a href="qfiledialog.html">QFileDialog</a></a> (in
Qtopia we use the document view system instead of exposing the file
system to the user), <a href=qcolordialog.html>
<a href="qcolordialog.html">QColorDialog</a></a>, <a href=qprogressdialog.html>
<a href="qprogressdialog.html">QProgressDialog</a></a>, <a href=qprintdialog.html>
QPrintDialog</a>, <a href=qinputdialog.html> <a href="qinputdialog.html">QInputDialog</a></a>
<p> </ul>
<p> If a developer attempts to use a component that has been removed from the <a href="qt.html">Qt</a>/Embedded for Qtopia offering, the developer will see a compiler error.
<p> <h2> Qtopia, Qt Versions and Binary Compatibility
</h2>
<a name="4"></a><p> Qtopia has shipped on the Sharp Zaurus 5500 and other embedded
devices. Qtopia embedded requires Qt/Embedded 2.3. Qtopia Desktop
requires Qt/Desktop (either X11, Windows or Mac) version 3.1.x.
<p> When the developer compiles their application, it must be compiled and
linked against a binary compatible version of Qtopia and Qt/Embedded
for that platform on the device. It is highly recommended for
application authors to compile and link their applications using the
latest SDKs provided by Trolltech to ensure binary
compatibility. Please visit <a
href=http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qtopia.html>
Trolltech's Qtopia developer download page</a> for links to the latest
commercial and GPL SDKs.
<p> A library is binary compatible, if a program linked dynamically to a
former version of the library continues running with newer versions of
the library without the need to recompile. So applications compiled
and linked for libqpe 1.5.0 should still link with libqpe 1.5.2 and
vice-versa. If binary compatibility is broken, the application will
not run on the target devices. To ensure binary compatibility, <b>do
not change any Qtopia API</b>. 
<p> Functionality that is added to Qtopia 1.x will mainly be added through
add-on libraries. These add on libraries can be installed ontop of
Qtopia 1.x. This will allow Qtopia 2 applications to run on a
Qtopia 1.x device, as long as the Qtopia 2 applications depend on
these 1.x libraries in the .ipk control files. These libraries should
then be automatically installed due the dependency.
<p> <h2> Qtopia Platform
</h2>
<a name="5"></a><p> Qtopia platform consists of the Qtopia libraries (<a href="qt.html">Qt</a>/E, libqpe,
libqtopia1, qtopiapim) and the Qtopia server/launcher. Application
developers should use these libraries when writing applications for a
Qtopia device. The Qtopia launcher/server is the main process that
controls the windowing system, interprocess communication, launching
all applications and other central tasks. 
<p> Please refer to
the Qtopia Developer Reference Manual for
more documentation about what is provided in the Qtopia library.  This
library links agains Qt/Embedded 2.3.
<p> Note that the Qtopia core API has been broken up into two seperate
libraries. One library is called libqpe and the other library is
libqtopia1. libqpe 1.5.2 is binary compatible with the existing libqpe
1.5.0 and libqpe 1.5.1 libraries. libqtopia1 contains the source code
for the additional methods and classes added to Qtopia for the
Qtopia 1.6.0 release. Qtopia 1.6 applications depend on both of
these libraries. Qtopia 1.5 devices will be able to install Qtopia 1.6
applications by installing libqtopia1 and any other libraries they
need.
<p> When you create a package, make sure you state all library
dependencies so the package installer knows what it needs to install
before your application can run. Please read the <a
href=distrib.html>distribution packaging</a> for more information
regarding packaging and dependencies.
<p> <h3> Qtopia PIM Access Library
</h3>
<a name="5-1"></a><p> A separate library is provided for the embedded device to access the
Qtopia PIM information. An application can depend on this ipkg for use
of their application, and it will automatically be installed by the
Application Installer software on Qtopia Desktop and Add/Remove
Software Application. Please refer to <a href="qpepim.html">QPEPIM Library
documentation</a> for more information. This library also depends
on libqpe and libqtopia1 and <a href="qt.html">Qt</a>/Embedded 2.3.
