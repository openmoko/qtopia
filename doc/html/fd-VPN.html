<p>[<span class="nobr"><a href="fd-OpenVPN.html" title="http://OpenVPN.net">OpenVPN<sup></sup></a></span>] uses SSL to connect two partner across the Internet. The connection ensures the integrity and privacy of data. OpenVPN can operate in a Routing mode which connects two end points by using SSL and in a more advanced Tunneling mode which adds true VPN support. It provides excellent support for road warriors as it works in NAT environments and is similar to a situation whereby the user feels as if he would actually sit in his work office. All services provided by the user's home network are available from the remote machine. The experience even extends to the point that non-IP based services can be used. OpenVPN's main advantages are its simplicity, the high level of security, it's not limited to IP traffic and its can work in network environments where NAT is used. The main disadvantage is the fact that it is more CPU intensive than e.g. IPSec due to encryption which is done in software (performance could be an issue on low powered devices).

<p>Qtopia provides a user front-end for OpenVPN allowing the user to configure an OpenVPN connection. In addition it is possible to configure such a connection via network scripts provided by system administrators. To enable OpenVPN support the image on the target device must provide OpenVPN 2.0 or higher.</p>
