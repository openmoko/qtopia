<p> <h2> Introduction
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> Qtopia is a platform for embedded Linux devices. Qtopia provides the
end-user with a set of core applications that are expected on modern
embedded platforms such as PIM applications (Address Book, Calendar
and Todo) and a Media Player.
<p> Qtopia provides the developer with a clean object-oriented API to
write applications for an embedded device. Most of the API presented
to the developer is the same API offered by Trolltech for
cross-platform development between Windows, Mac and the UNIX's. The
same code can be shared and reused on all of these desktop platforms
and now Qtopia is just another platform to run your great Qt applications.
<p> The Qtopia platform encomposses both the software that runs on an
embedded device and the software that runs on a end-users desktop. The
software that runs on the desktop, called Qtopia Desktop, allows the
user to input Qtopia application information on their desktop and
synchronize their data between the embedded device and the
desktop. Qtopia Desktop allows the developer to write plugins into the
desktop to synchronize their information. Please refer to the
<a href="qtopiadesktop.html">Qtopia Desktop documentation</a> for
more information.
<p> For the most up to date documentation and product information for
Qtopia, please visit <a

website</a>.
<p> <h2> Software Stack
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> The Qtopia software stack on the embedded device has four main layers
as shown in the following image.
<p> <center><img src="stack.png" width="254" height="291"></center> Insignia's Java is written on top of Qt/Embedded (and a Qt/AWT
implementation). Other applications such as Opera's Web Browser and
Handcom Office Suite is written ontop of Qt/Embedded and Qtopia.
<p> <h2> Qt/Embedded is a Subset Qt/Desktop
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> Trolltech's flagship product, Qt, is an API for cross-platform C++ development. Qt/Embedded allows applications written for the Qt/API to be recompiled and run for an embedded architecture, such as StrongARM.
<p> It is intended that an application that is written for an embedded
device can use the same code (or a subset, if it offers a subset of
the functionality) that is used on the desktop. This allows the
developer to have a single source tree for the entire application
suite offering.
<p> In fact, the developer will not see a different API for Qt/Embedded in
the Qt documenation. However, a subset of what is offered on the
Qt/Desktop is provided in Qt/Embedded. This is neccessary since
Qt/Embedded has different library size and speed constraints than the
desktop some modules of Qt are not offered. These modules where chosen
due to their large size, inherently slow speed or because they do not
belong or are not necessary on an embedded device. For some of the
modules, a description is provided if it is not obvious why this was
left out of the Qt/Embedded offering for Qtopia.
<p> <ul>
<li> Core Qt: <a href=../qt/properties.html> properties</a>, <a
href=../qt/network.html> networking module</a>, <a
href=../qt/coordsys.html>transformations</a>, <a
href=../qt/qprinter.html>QPrinter</a> , <a href=../qt/xml.html> XML
module</a> (too large and too slow to use)
<p> <li> UI: <a href=../qt/qtextcodec.html> QTextCodec</a>, <a
href=../qt/dnd.html>drag and drop</a>, <a href=emb-fonts.html>free
type fonts</a>, extra styles (i.e. Motif),
<p> <li> Images: No PPM images for <a
href=../qt/qimageio.html>QImageIO</a>, <a
href=../qt/qpicture.html>QPicture</a>
<p> <li> QWidgets: <a href=../qt/qsplitter.html> QSplitter</a>, <a
href=../qt/qdial.html> QDial</a>, <a
href=../qt/qworkspace.html>QWorkspace</a>
<p> <li> QDialogs: <a href=../qt/qfiledialog.html> QFileDialog</a> (in
Qtopia we use the document view system instead of exposing the file
system to the user), <a href=../qt/qcolordialog.html>
QColorDialog</a>, <a href=../qt/qprogressdialog.html>
QProgressDialog</a>, <a href=../qt/qprintdialog.html>
QPrintDialog</a>, <a href=../qt/qwizard.html> QWizard</a>, <a
href=../qt/qinputdialog.html> QInputDialog</a>
<p> </ul>
<p> If a developer attempts to use a component that has been removed from the Qt/Embedded for Qtopia offering, the developer will see a compiler error.
<p> <h2> Qtopia, Qt Versions and Binary Compatibility
</h2>
<a name="4"></a><p> Qtopia was delivered and shipped on the Sharp Zaurus 5500
and is planned for several more devices.
Qtopia embedded requires Qt/Embedded 2.3. Qtopia Desktop
requires Qt/Desktop (either X11, Windows or Mac) version 3.
<p> When the developer compiles their application, it must be compiled and
linked against a binary compatible version of Qtopia and Qt/Embedded
for that platform on the device. It is highly recommended for
application authors to compile and link their applications using SDKs
provided by Trolltech to ensure binary compatibility. Binary
compatability refers to the libraries an application links against and
ensuring all methods the applications refer to in their core libraries
exist and with the same signature they are expecting. If binary
compatibility is broken, the application will not run on the target
devices. Please visit <a
href=http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qtopia.html>
Trolltech's Qtopia developer download page</a> for links to commercial
and GPL SDKs.
<p> The next major version of Qtopia will be Qtopia 2. Qtopia 2 will continue 
to link against Qt 2.3.x.
It is our intention that binary and source compatibility is kept
between Qtopia 1.x and Qtopia 2.x. That being said, many methods may be
depricated starting in Qtopia 2.
<p> Functionality that is added to Qtopia 1.x will mainly be added through
add-on libraries. These add on libraries can be installed ontop of
Qtopia 1.x. This will allow Qtopia 2 applications to run on a
Qtopia 1.x device, as long as the Qtopia 2 applications depend on
these 1.x libraries in the .ipk control files. These libraries should
then be automatically installed due the dependency.
<p> One last note regarding Qtopia versions and binary compatibility. From now
on, the major version of Qtopia will correspond to the major version of Qt
that it depends upon. So Qtopia 2.x series will depend on Qt/E 2.3.x.
Qtopia 3 will depend on Qt/E 3.x and so on.
<p> <h2> Qtopia Library
</h2>
<a name="5"></a><p> Qtopia provides an extra library above what is provided by
Qt/Embedded. Specifically, the Qtopia library provides the foundation
for the Qtopia platform on the embedded device.
Please refer to the Qtopia Developer Reference Manual
for more documentation about what is provided in the Qtopia library.
This library links agains Qt/Embedded 2.3.
<p> <h3> Qtopia PIM Access Library
</h3>
<a name="5-1"></a><p> A separate library is provided for the embedded device to access the
Qtopia PIM information. An application can depend on this ipkg for use
of their application, and it will automatically be installed by the
Application Installer software on Qtopia Desktop and Add/Remove
Software Application. Please refer to <a href="qpepim.html">QPEPIM Library
documentation</a> for more information. This library also depends
on Qtopia 1.5 and Qt/Embedded 2.3.
