<p> <h2> Qtopia - Filesystem standards
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> Qtopia software is installed in the <tt>/opt/Qtopia</tt> directory of the
target system. Within this directory, applications must follow the
file placement standards described in this document.
<p> <center><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" border="0">
<tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">
<td valign="top"><b>appname</b>
<td valign="top">this is the application's executable filename. It should be globally
unique. Since this names is almost never seen or entered by the
end-user, it is completely appropriate to use long and complex names,
such as "abc-textedit-3".
<tr bgcolor="#d0d0d0">
<td valign="top"><b>language</b>
<td valign="top">this is the ISO639 langauge code (e.g. "de" for German).
</table></center>
<p> <a name="desktop"></a>
<big>/opt/Qtopia/apps/<b>category</b>/<b>appname</b>.desktop</big>
<p> The <b>category</b> must be one of the following:
<ol type=1>
<li> <b>Settings</b> if the software configures functionality which
has an ongoing effect on the user's environment. Such software
never creates Documents.
<li> <b>Games</b> if the software is solely for amusement purposes.
<li> <b>Applications</b> for all other software.
</ol>
<p> These categories have been chosen because it is very easy for the user
to differentiate between them.
<p> To install software in other categories would create confusion. For example,
you should <em>not</em> attempt to categorize your software as a "Utility",
as it is difficult for people to differentiate this categorization from
the Settings and Applications categories (it falls somewhere in between).
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/bin/<b>appname</b></big>
<p> This is the executable program of the software. Note that it is
<em>not</em> appropriate to use the same executable with arguments to
modify it's behaviour, since only one instance of each application
will be run (additional attempts to run the application merely raise
the previous instance).
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/pics/<b>appname</b>/...</big>
<p> Any image files the application needs to use should either be standard
built-in images, or be files in this application-specific directory.
See the <a href="resource.html">Resource</a> class for an explanation of how to access these
files.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/apps/<b>Category/appname.desktop</b></big>
<p> The .desktop file specifies an entry in the launcher and start
menu. The Category should be one of [Applications|Games|Settings],
reflecting the launcher Category you want the application to appear
in. The file format is similar to the file format used by the Unix
desktops KDE and Gnome. The format is as follows. Lines beginning with
a '#' are ignored as comments. 
<p> <pre>
[Desktop Entry]
# the line above is mandatory at the beginning of the file
# Exec specifies the name of the executable that should be in /opt/Qtopia/bin
Exec=executablename
# This should always be Application for links to applications.
Type=Application
# Specifies the icon to be found in /opt/Qtopia/pics. Endings are autodetected.
# The icons should be at least 32x32 and should smooth-scale well
# from 14x14 to at least 48x48
Icon=Iconfile
# The mimetype entry specifies a comma separated list of mimetypes this application can handle.
<a href="mimetype.html">MimeType</a>=/audio/mp3
# the next lines specify the name of the application as it should appear in the launcher
# and start menu
Name=My fancy application
# and if you want to support different languages:
Name[de]=Meine Anwendung

The whole file has to be encoded in utf8.

</pre><p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/sounds/<b>appname</b>/...</big>
<p> Any sound files the application needs to use should either be standard
built-in sounds, or be files in this application-specific directory.
See the <a href="resource.html">Resource</a> class for an explanation of how to access these
files.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/i18n/<b>language</b>/<b>appname</b>.qm</big>
<p> These files are translations of the software (see <a href="i18n.html">Internationalization</a>).
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/help/html/<b>appname</b><b>-suffixes</b>.html
<p> These files are the English online documentation of the software (the
<b>-suffixes</b> is optional). Note that on-line documentation can
refer to images under the <tt>/opt/Qtopia/pics</tt> directory, so you can
refer to icons and other images explicitly without duplicating the
files.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/help/<b>language</b>/html/<b>appname</b><b>-suffixes</b>.html</big>
<p> These files are the online documentation of the software (the
<b>-suffixes</b> is optional), in the language specified.
The suffixes are the choice of the application developer,
but Qtopia will automatically connect the Help button in the
window decorations to <b>appname</b>-<b>widgetname</b>.html
if such a file exists, thus allowing different application
windows to have different associated help pages.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/lib/<b>appname</b>/...</big>
<p> Applications may put files in this directory as required.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/plugins/applets</big>
<p> Taskbar applets are placed in this directory.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/plugins/codecs</big>
<p> Mediaplayer codecs are placed in this directory.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/plugins/fontfactories</big>
<p> Font factory extensions are placed in this directory.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/plugins/inputmethods</big>
<p> Input Method plugins are placed in this directory.
<p> <big>/opt/Qtopia/plugins/network</big>
<p> Network setup modules are placed in this directory.
