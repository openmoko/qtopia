To add functionality to the Qtopia Environment, download the
sourcecode to both Qt/Embedded and the Qtopia Environment
from Trolltech's website (http://www.trolltech.com). The API used
is the same as normal Qt for X11 and Windows, so you can choose to
develop your applications there first, but keep in mind the much
smaller screen size that the Qtopia Environment is intended
to be used on.
