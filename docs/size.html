Qt/Embedded is modular and scalable. You can assemble the
Qt features you really need and leave the others out.
<p>
Qt/Embedded includes the GUI server, client libraries, and window manager.
<p>
By picking and choosing features, the memory demands of
Qt/Embedded can be tuned between 800Kb and 3 Mb in ROM (Intel x86).
<p>
Applications written with Qt have a small
memory footprint compared to applications written with other toolkits
due to sharing of the rich feature-set in the library.
