When using a stylus or a mouse, press-and-hold rather than tapping or clicking
on an item to activate additional functionality, such as a menu of options.
<p>
For example, in the Mine Sweep game, press-and-hold to mark the location of
a bomb. In the File Browser, press-and-hold on a filename to choose an
operation to perform on the file.
