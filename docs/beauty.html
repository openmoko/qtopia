Qt/Embedded features some great additional functionality compared
to X11. You will be stunned by the beauty of anti-aliased text and alpha
blended pixmaps. These new features could add an additional touch of class to a
user interface. Forget about embedded graphics which looks more like old
alphanumeric terminals. Qt/Embedded can utilize hardware graphics acceleration
and it is well suited for multimedia and web applications. Let Qt/Embedded
impress you and your customers.
