support for zylonite device (Marvell)

- backlight, see custom.cpp, system integrator needs to 
             implement backlight.sh <brightness level>

- Battery Status and Charging Management, see server/apmbattery.cpp
             This is commented out since no apm support but can be used as
             reference for implementation, ideally though you should not use polling.

- removable media handling, see Storage.conf
             /etc/udev/scripts/mount.sh is run on insert or remove of SD card
             it sends message to Qtopia of change.

- handling handfree, see server/zylonitehardware.cpp 
             (this is where you would do this)

- handling system volume, see server/zylonitevolumeservice.cpp
             (this is where you would do this)

- handling suspend/resume, see server/zylonitesuspend.cpp
             (this is where you would do this)

- handling key inputs, see src/plugins/qtopiacore/kbddrivers/zylonite/*
