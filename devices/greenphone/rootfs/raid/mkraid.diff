- recommended to use the lsraid utility and to read the lsraid HOWTO.

- If your RAID array holds useful and not yet backed up data then --force
- and the hot-add/hot-remove functionality should be used with extreme care!
- If your /etc/raidtab file is not in sync with the real array configuration,
- then --force might DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA. It's especially dangerous to use
- -f if the array is in degraded mode.
-
- If your /etc/raidtab file matches the real layout of on-disk data then
- recreating the array will not hurt your data, but be aware of the risks
- of doing this anyway: freshly created RAID1 and RAID5 arrays do a full
- resync of their mirror/parity blocks, which, if the raidtab is incorrect,
- the resync will wipe out data irrecoverably. Also, if your array is in
- degraded mode then the raidtab must match the degraded config exactly,
- otherwise you'll get the same kind of data destruction during resync.
- (see the failed-disk raidtab option.) You have been warned!

- [ If your array holds no data, or you have it all backed up, or if you
- know precisely what you are doing and you still want to proceed then use
- the --really-force (or -R) flag. ]
