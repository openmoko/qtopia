<h1>DialUp Plugin Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>

<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
Allows serial port and IrDA modem network connections.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
Adds two service types in the Network Settings - one for serial
ports such as CF modem cards, the other for IrDA connections.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
 -->
<ul>
<li><b>CF modem</b>
    <p>User inserts CF modem, selects the dialup connection,
	and uses the internet. 
<li><b>IrDA via cellphone</b>
    <p>User places an IrDA phone within range, selects the dialup
	connection, and uses the internet. 
<li><b>Demand dialing</b>
    <p>User inserts CF modem or places an IrDA phone within range,
	and use the internet. The modem is dialed automatically
	(user has earlier enabled that option).
<li><b>ISP configuration</b>
    <p>When user subscribes to an ISP, he receives a disk containing
	setup software, including a package for Qtopia, which includes
	phone number and other configuration details. User installs
	the package and then has dialup access without
	manual configuration.
</ul>

<a name=features>
<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Parameterized: most parameters for the ppp connection
	can be set by defaults in a configuration file,
	so that, for example, an ISP can provide a complete
	service definition that the user just enables and
	uses - with the phone number, password, etc., predefined.
<li>Serial modem: when a CF modem is inserted, the dialup services
	become available (see Network Monitor applet).
<li>IrDA modem: available when the user has enabled IR
	(not implemented: and a phone is discovered).
</ul>

<a name=prerequisites>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
</a>
<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>IrDA discovery: the irda service (/etc/rc.d/init.d/irda)
	must run irattach in discovery mode (-s option).
</ul>
