<h1>Network Monitor Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>

<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
The Network Monitor is the user interface for activating networking.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
The Network Monitor presents available services to the user, allows
services to be initiated, prompting for passwords if required, and
continuously showing the status of networking when relevant.

Status: RT

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
 -->
<ul>
<li><b>LAN card</b>
    <p>User plugs in a CF LAN card, and can then access the Internet.
<li><b>Multiple LAN</b>
    <p>(not implemented: User plugs in a CF LAN card, but as 2 differently-configured
	services are defined, the user must choose a service before any connection is made.)
<li><b>Modem card</b>
    <p>User plugs in a CF Modem card, and can then access the Internet.
	As an option, the password for the service must be input before
	the connection proceeds. At any time, user can drop connection
	via a menu or by pulling out the CF card. The menu can be used
	to re-establish the connection.
<li><b>Cellphone Modem</b>
    <p>(not implemented: User puts cellphone near th device IR, then requests that a
	IrDA, Bluetooth, etc. network be established. Once connected,
	the user can then access the Internet. At any time, user can drop connection
        via a menu or by breaking the connection on the phone.
	The menu can be used to re-establish the connection.)
<li><b>Demand Dialing</b>
    <p>User runs web browser and goes to a URL. An appropriate
	network service is initiated, possibly requiring user interaction
	(eg.  selecting service, entering password).
<li><b>New Hardware</b>
    <p>User buys hypothetical new NURV Synapsis CF Card, which includes
	a software package for the device. After installing the software
	package, the NURV card can be used in the same manner as other
	services.
</ul>

<a name=features>
<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Choose services: a menu shows available network services.
<li>Password: some services require a password to be entered,
	and this functionality is provided in the architecture.
<li>Current state: an icon indicates current network availability.
<li>Network plugins: network services are ultimately defined by executable code
	in plugins coupled with configuration parameters. In this way,
	new software can be supplied for new hardware.
</ul>

<a name=prerequisites>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
</a>
<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Demand Dialing: demand dialing requires that the PPP service
	can support the "demand" option.
</ul>
