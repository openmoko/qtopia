<h1>Clipboard Applet Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>
-->

<a name=description>
</a>
<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
The Clipboard applet allows simple cut copy and paste operations.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
Using the clipboard is precisely equivalent to sending the corresponding
key sequences to the current application.

<a name=usecases>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
 -->
<ul>
<li><b>Create event from Email</b>
    <p>The user receives an email that talks about
    an upcoming concert, giving various details of dates, times,
    and descriptions. By using the clipboard, the user copies the
    start time, end time, and description from the email into
    the corresponding fields of a new event.
    (not implemented: they can also copy the date in a number of common formats.)
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Text Cut: equivalent to pressing "Control-X" on a keyboard.
<li>Text Copy: equivalent to pressing "Control-C" on a keyboard.
	(including sending that as an interrupt in the terminal)
<li>Text Paste: equivalent to pressing "Control-V" on a keyboard.
</ul>

<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
