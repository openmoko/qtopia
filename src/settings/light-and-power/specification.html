<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Quick Suspend</b>
    <p>
    To help reduce power consumption while on battery power,
    the user sets the device to dim the
    light after 10 seconds of inactivity; after another 10 seconds, the
    light turns off completely (but the screen is still visible by ambient light);
    after another 10 seconds, the device enters a suspend mode. However, when
    the device is on mains power, the user sets it to dim the display after 5
    minutes, and not power down any further.
<li><b>Network download</b>
    <p>
    While online with a slow connection, the user must often wait for
    many minutes for downloads and other operations to complete. He therefore
    configures his device to never suspend while the network is up.
<li><b>Automatic light control</b>
    <p>
    The user configures the screen light to vary automatically based on
    the amount of ambient light. This way, in dark places the light is low,
    in medium-lit places it is bright, and in very bright places it is turned
    off (for reflective displays).  (not implemented on current devices)
