#include "phonesecurity.h"

/* IN Phone mode...

   Handles pins for the SIM Card lock (e.g. access to the sim card, ability to make calls, etc),
   and Phone To Sim Lock (e.g. can access data on the phone while a different sim card is inserted).

   As these seem to be standard across all Ericssons at least.

   Other codes to handle might include:

   P2, (SIM Card 2 pin)
   CS, (Lock Control surface).

   Does NOT currently do the normal Security.conf password protection.

   GUI needs to change to 'list then item' selection.  hrm.
