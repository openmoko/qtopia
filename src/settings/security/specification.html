<h1>Security Settings Specification</h1>

<a name=description>
</a>
The Security Settings application sets restrictions on access
to the device.
<p>
The Security Settings application lets a user set restrictions on access
to the device, which includes physical access and syncing from particular
hosts.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Prevent Unauthorized Physical Access</b>
    <p>
    A Qtopia-powered device left unattended can be prevented from being
    used casually by requiring the user's passcode be enabled at power-on.
    An unattended device can still be stolen and compromised in various ways.
<li><b>Prevent Unauthorized Network Access</b>
    <p>
    A malicious person may attempt to disrupt the owner of a device by repeatedly
    attempting to connect (forcing the owner to deny the connection).
    Qtopia provides features to prevent this "denial of service" attack.
<li><b>Wireless Synchronization</b>
    <p>
    Rather than have to place his device in a cradle, the user leaves it in his
    briefcase, and uses a wireless connection to connect to the device. The
    connection is significantly faster than his serial cradle connection.
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<ul>
<li>Passcode required at power-on: Users are able to set their own passcodes.
    The device will require the passcode at power-on to operate.
<li>Connection confirmation: when a connection is attempted, Qtopia informs
    the connector of the device ID. If the connector responds with a valid
    password, then the connection proceeds, otherwise, a dialog is shown
    to request confirmation from the user. If the user allows the connection,
    the password is stored to allow future connections without interaction.
    <!-- actually implemented in the server -->
<li>Three attempts: after three connection attempts are denied by the user,
    all connections will be refused until 10 minutes have elapse without any
    unauthorized connections. Therefore a remote user can only attempt three
    passwords every 10 minutes - far insufficient to crack the device by brute
    force password search. Additionally, they cannot annoy the device user.
    <!-- actually implemented in the server -->
<li>Network sync restriction: Only allow the device to synchronize to hosts
    specified. This gives the user additional security as often a single trusted
    network will be used for synchronization.
</ul>

<a name=prerequisites>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
</a>

<ul>
<li>Network sync: requires TCP/IP network connectivity.
<li>Additional filtering: specific devices may place additional restrictions on
	connections, such as requiring that they come from a USB network
	device (thereby restricting synchronization to occur only via
	a USB cradle).
</ul>
