<h1>Language Setting Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>

<a name=description>
</a>
<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
Allows the user to choose User Interface language.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
The user can choose the language to be used for the interface and
the documentation of applications. If the language chosen is not
available for a particular application, a default is used.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
 -->
<ul>
<li><b>Initial Purchase</b>
    <p>A Norwegian-speaking user purchases her device in Austria. The default
	language for the device is German. By using the Language Settings,
	shown as "Sprache" in the "Einstellungen" tab, but fortunately
	with a recognization icon, she changes the language to Norwegian,
	shown as "Norwegisch (Norsk)". (not implemented: the first use
	application gives the user the option to choose language).
<li><b>Language Learner</b>
    <p>User is an American recently relocated to Italy. In order to facilitate
	his learning of Italian, he switches his device to Italian. Occassionally
	though, he switches back to English for some more complicated applications.
</ul>

<a name=features>
<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Choose language: all available languages are listed for selection.
<li>Language translation: each language option is shown in that language,
	and in the current language.
<li>Documentation translation: the language selection also determines the
	language used for Help Documentation.
<li>No change to current applications: applications must be restarted before
	they use the newly selected language.
</ul>

<a name=prerequisites>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Translations: only applications which have appropriate translation files
	will be translated - others will use a default language.
</ul>
