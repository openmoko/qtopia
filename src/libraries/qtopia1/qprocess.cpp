  \class QProcess qprocess.h

  \brief The QProcess class is used to start external programs and to
  communicate with them.

  This is a temporary class. This will be replaced by Qt 3's QProcess class.

/*!
  \enum QProcess::Communication

  This enum type defines the communication channels connected to the
  process.

  \value Stdin  Data can be written to the process's standard input.

  \value Stdout  Data can be read from the process's standard output.

  \value Stderr  Data can be read from the process's standard error.

  \value DupStderr  Duplicates standard error to standard output for new
  processes; i.e.  everything that the process writes to standard error, is
  reported by QProcess on standard output instead. This is especially useful if
  your application requires that the output on standard output and standard
  error is read in the same order as the process output it. Please note that
  this is a binary flag, so if you want to activate this together with standard
  input, output and error redirection (the default), you have to specify
  \c{Stdin|Stdout|Stderr|DupStderr} for the setCommunication() call.

  Runs the process and writes the data \a buf to the process's standard input.
  If all the data is written to standard input, standard input is
  closed. The command is searched for in the path for executable programs;
  you can also use an absolute path in the command itself.

  If \a env is null, then the process is started with the same environment as
  the starting process. If \a env is non-null, then the values in the
  stringlist are interpreted as environment setttings of the form \c
  {key=value} and the process is started with these environment settings. For
  convenience, there is a small exception to this rule under Unix: if \a env
  does not contain any settings for the environment variable \c
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, then this variable is inherited from the starting process.

  Returns TRUE if the process could be started; otherwise returns FALSE.

  Note that you should not use the slots writeToStdin() and closeStdin() on
  processes started with launch(), since the result is not well-defined. If you
  need these slots, use start() instead.

  The process may or may not read the \a buf data sent to its standard
  input.

  You can call this function even when a process that was started with
  this instance is still running. Be aware that if you do this the
  standard input of the process that was launched first will be
  closed, with any pending data being deleted, and the process will be
  left to run out of your control. Similarly, if the process could not
  be started the standard input will be closed and the pending data
  deleted. (On operating systems that have zombie processes, Qt will
  also wait() on the old process.)

  The object emits the signal launchFinished() when this function
  call is finished. If the start was successful, this signal is
  emitted after all the data has been written to standard input. If
  the start failed, then this signal is emitted immediately.
