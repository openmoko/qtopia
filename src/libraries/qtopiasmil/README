Qtopia SMIL 2.0 parser/viewer

This SMIL viewer is intended for use with an MMS viewer.  It does not
necessarily implement any more than required by MMS Conformance Document 1.2
Candidate Version 29-September-2003 (OMA-MMS-CONF-v1_2-20030929-C).

In reality, it covers a reasonable subset of SMIL 2.0 basic and
it should be quite possible to implement SMIL 2.0 basic language
specification without too many headaches.
