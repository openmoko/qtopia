/*!
    \class QObexFtpClient
    \mainclass
    \brief The QObexFtpClient class provides an implementation of the OBEX file-transfer mechanism.

    The class works asynchronously, so there are no blocking functions. If an
    operation cannot be executed immediately, the function will still return
    straight away and the operation will be scheduled for later execution. The
    results of scheduled operations are reported via signals. This approach
    depends on the event loop being in operation.

    The operations that can be scheduled (they are called "commands" in the rest
    of the documentation) are the following: connect(), disconnect(),
    list(), cd(), cdUp(), get(), put(), remove(), mkdir(), rmdir()

    All of these commands return a unique identifier that allows you to keep
    track of the command that is currently being executed. When the execution of
    a command starts, the commandStarted() signal with the command's identifier
    is emitted. When the command is finished, the commandFinished() signal is
    emitted with the command's identifier and a bool that indicates whether the
    command finished with an error.

    When the last scheduled command has finished, a done() signal is emitted
    with a bool argument that tells you whether the sequence finished with an
    error.

    If an error occurs during the execution of one of the commands in a sequence
    of commands, all the pending commands (i.e. scheduled, but not yet executed
    commands) are cleared and no signals are emitted for them.

    Some commands, e.g. list(), emit additional signals to report their results.

    An example of using this class is:
    \code
        ftp->connect();                             // id == 1
        ftp->cd("foo");                             // id == 2
        ftp->get("bar");                            // id == 3
        ftp->disconnect();                          // id == 4
    \endcode

    get() and put() operations report the progress of the transfer using the
    dataTransferProgress() signal.  If no IODevice is associated with a get,
    then the readyRead() signal is emitted.  In this case the data can be
    obtained with the read() or readAll().

    You can then get details about the error with the error() and
    errorString() functions.

    The functions currentId() and currentCommand() provide more information
    about the currently executing command.

    The functions hasPendingCommands() and clearPendingCommands() allow you
    to query and clear the list of pending commands.
