    \class QObexPushClient
    \mainclass
    \brief The QObexPushClient class encapsulates an OBEX PUSH client.

    The QObexPushClient class can be used to send files to an OBEX Push
    server.  The file sent can either be a business card (vCard), calendar (vCal),
    or any other file type.  This class can also be used to request a business card,
    or perform a business card exchange.

    Here is an example of using QObexPushClient to send a file over a
    Bluetooth connection:

    \code
    // Connect to an RFCOMM server
    QBluetoothRfcommSocket *rfcommSocket = new QBluetoothRfcommSocket;
    if (rfcommSocket->connect("11:22:33:aa:bb:cc", 9)) {

        QObexPushClient *sender = new QObexPushClient(rfcommSocket);
        sender->connect();
        QByteArray data = getSomeData();
        sender->send(data, "MyData.txt");
        sender->disconnect();
    }
    \endcode

    The functions connect(), disconnect(), send(), sendBusinessCard(),
    requestBusinessCard() and exchangeBusinessCard() are all asynchronous.
    When called, they return immediately, returning a unique identifier
    for that particular operation. If the command cannot be performed
    immediately because another command is in progress, the command is
    scheduled for later execution.

    When the execution of a command starts, the commandStarted() signal is
    emitted with the identifier of the command. When it is finished, the
    commandFinished() signal is emitted with the identifier and also a bool to
    indicate whether the command finished with an error.

    The done() signal is emitted when all pending commands have finished. This
    can be used to automatically delete the client object when it has finished
    its operations, by connecting the client's done() signal to the client's
    QObject::deleteLater() slot. (The QIODevice object can similarly be connected
    to automatically delete it when the client has finished.)

    If an error occurs during the execution of one of the commands in a
    sequence of commands, all the pending commands (i.e. scheduled, but not
    yet executed commands) are cleared and no signals are emitted for them.
    In this case, the done() signal is emitted with the error argument set to
    \c true.

In this case, the client and server are no longer synchronized with each other, so the QIODevice provided in the constructor should not be used for any more OBEX requests.
