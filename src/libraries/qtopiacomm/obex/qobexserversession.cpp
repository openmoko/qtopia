/*!
    \class QObexServerSession
    \brief The QObexServerSession class provides an abstract base class for implementing an OBEX server.

    To implement an OBEX server, subclass QObexServerSession and override
    the protected slots that correspond to the requests to be handled by your
    server, as shown below.

    QObexServerSession can accept OBEX client requests over any transport
    that is provided through a subclass of QIODevice. For example,
    QBluetoothRfcommSocket, QIrSocket and QTcpSocket are all subclasses of
    QIODevice, and objects of these subclasses can passed to the
    QObexServerSession constructor to run OBEX servers over RFCOMM, IrDA
    or TCP, respectively.


    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Receiving client requests

    In order to receive requests from an OBEX client, your QObexServerSession
    subclass must override the protected slots for the requests that it wants
    to receive. For example, if you want to receive \c Connect requests,
    you must override the corresponding connect() slot, which will be called
    each time a \c Connect request is received:

    \code
    class SimpleObexServer : public QObexServerSession
    {
        Q_OBJECT
    public:
        SimpleObexServer(QIODevice *device, QObject *parent = 0)
            : QObexServerSession(device, parent)
        {
        }

    protected slots:
        QObex::ResponseCode connect(const QObexHeader &header)
        {
            qDebug() << "Received a CONNECT request";

            // Return QObex::Success to allow the request, or return
            // some other response code to deny the request.
            return QObex::Success;
        }
    };
    \endcode

    Other slots are similarly named according to their request types. Here
    are the types of requests that can be received by a subclass of
    QObexServerSession, and the corresponding slots that must be overridden
    to receive them:

    \table
    \header
        \o Request type
        \o Protected slot
    \row
        \o \c Connect
        \o connect()
    \row
        \o \c Disconnect
        \o disconnect()
    \row
        \o \c Put
        \o put()
    \row
        \o \c Put-Delete
        \o putDelete()
    \row
        \o \c Get
        \o get()
    \row
        \o \c SetPath
        \o setPath()
    \endtable

    If a client sends a request but the server subclass has not overridden the slot for
    that particular type of request, the request will automatically be denied
    by returning a QObex::NotImplemented response to the client.

    There is no corresponding slot for \c Abort requests. When an \c Abort
    request is received, error() will be called with an error value of
    QObexServerSession::Aborted. \c Abort requests cannot be denied.


    \section1 Handling \c Put and \c Get requests

    When a \c Put request is received, the put() slot is called with the
    initial request headers. This allows you to refuse the request before
    any body data is received. Then, the virtual dataAvailable() function
    is called each time body data is received for the \c Put
    request. You can return a non-success response from dataAvaiable()
    to cancel the \c Put operaton. Here is an example subclass implementation:

    \code
    private:
        QFile *m_incomingFile;

    protected slots:
        QObex::ResponseCode put(const QObexHeader &header)
        {
            // Reject the PUT request if the requested file cannot be opened
            QString incomingFilename = header.filename();
            m_incomingFile = new QFile(incomingFilename);

            if (!m_incomingFile->open(QIODevice::WriteOnly)) {
                delete m_incomingFile;
                return QObex::InternalServerError;
            }

            return QObex::Success;
        }

    protected:
        QObex::ResponseCode dataAvailable(const char *data, qint64 size)
        {
            if (size > 0) {
                // Write the new data to file. If the data cannot be written, reject
                // the request.
                if (m_incomingFile->write(data, size) < 0) {
                    m_incomingFile->close();
                    return QObex::InternalServerError;
                }
            } else {
                qDebug() << "Received all PUT data";
                m_incomingFile->close();
            }

            return QObex::Success;
        }
    \endcode


    For \c Get requests, override the get() slot and override the
    provideData() function. The get() slot is called when the \c Get
    request is received, and provideData() is called each time
    the service is required to send more body data to the client. You can
    return a non-success response from provideData() to cancel the \c Get
    request.

    Note that when implementing provideData(), the subclass must ensure that
    the data remains valid until the next call to provideData(), or until
    the request is finished.

    Here is an example implementation:

    \code
    private:
        QFile *m_requestedFile;
        QByteArray m_lastSentBytes;

    protected slots:
        QObex::ResponseCode get(const QObexHeader &header)
        {
            QString requestedFilename = header.name();
            if (!QFile::exists(requestedFilename))
                return QObex::NotFound;

            m_requestedFile = new QFile(requestedFilename);
            if (!m_requestedFile->open(QIODevice::ReadOnly)) {
                delete m_requestedFile;
                return QObex::InternalServerError;
            }

            qDebug() << "Prepared for GET request for" << requestedFile;
            return QObex::Success;
        }

    protected:
        QObex::ResponseCode provideData(const char **data, qint64 *size)
        {
            // Read another data chunk from the file.
            // The read data is stored in m_lastSentBytes so that it remains
            // valid until the next call to provideData(), or until the
            // request is finished.
            m_lastSentBytes = m_requestedFile.read(1024);

            if (m_lastSentBytes.size() > 0) {
                *data = m_lastSentBytes.constData();
                *size = m_lastSentBytes.size();
                qDebug() << "Sending another" << size << "bytes";
            } else {
                *size = 0;
                m_requestedFile->close();
                m_lastSentBytes.clear();
                qDebug() << "Finished reading file";
            }

            return QObex::Success;
        }
    \endcode


    \section1 Handling errors and \c Abort requests

    If an error occurs while running the server, error() will be called
    with the corresponding error. The server should override this function
    to perform any clean-up actions that might be necessary.

    The error() function is also called when an OBEX client sends an
    \c Abort request to cancel a multi-packet request such as \c Put or
    \c Get. When an \c Abort request is received, the server will
    automatically respond with QObex::Success and call error() with
    the error argument set to QObexServerSession::Aborted. Therefore, if
    a server supports the \c Put or \c Get requests, it should override
    error() so that it can be notified of \c Abort requests and perform
    any clean-up actions that might be necessary.


    \section1 Handling socket disconnections

    You should ensure that the QIODevice provided in the constructor emits
    QIODevice::aboutToClose() or QObject::destroyed() when the associated
    transport connection is disconnected. If one of these signals
    are emitted, QObexServerSession will know the transport connection has
    been lost, and will call error() with the argument set to ConnectionError.

    This is particularly an issue for socket classes such as QTcpSocket that
    do not emit QIODevice::aboutToClose() when a \c disconnected() signal is
    emitted. In these cases, QObexServerSession will not know that the
    transport has been disconnected. To avoid this, you can make the socket
    emit QIODevice::aboutToClose() when it is disconnected:

    \code
    // make the socket emit aboutToClose() when disconnected() is emitted
    QObject::connect(socket, SIGNAL(disconnected()), socket, SIGNAL(aboutToClose()));
    \endcode

    Or, if the socket can be discarded as soon as it is disconnected:

    \code
    // delete the socket when the transport is disconnected
    QObject::connect(socket, SIGNAL(disconnected()), socket, SLOT(deleteLater()));
    \endcode
