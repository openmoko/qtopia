    \class QObexPushService
    \inpublicgroup QtBaseModule

    \brief The QObexPushService class provides an OBEX Push service.

    The QObexPushService class can be used to provide OBEX Push services
    over Bluetooth, Infrared or any other OBEX capable transport.
    This class implements the Bluetooth Object Push Profile, and can also
    be used to implement the Infrared IrXfer service.

    If you want to control whether an incoming file should be accepted,
    subclass QObexPushService and override the acceptFile() function.
    Subclasses can also override businessCard() to provide the default
    business card object that may be requested by an OBEX Push client.

    When an OBEX client sends a file to the service, the acceptFile() function
    is called to determine whether the file transfer should be allowed. If
    the transfer is accepted, the putRequested() signal is emitted with
    the details of the incoming file, and the dataTransferProgress() signal will be
    emitted at intervals to show the progress of the file transfer operation.
    The requestFinished() signal is emitted when the transfer is complete.

    Similarly, when an OBEX client requests the default business card, the
    businessCardRequested() signal is emitted, and the
    dataTransferProgress() signal will be emitted at intervals. The requestFinished()
    signal is emitted when the transfer is complete.

    Finally, the done() signal is emitted when the OBEX client disconnects or
    if the connection is terminated.


    \section1 Handling socket disconnections

    You should ensure that the QIODevice provided in the constructor emits
    QIODevice::aboutToClose() or QObject::destroyed() when the associated
    transport connection is disconnected. If one of these signals
    are emitted, QObexPushService will know the transport connection has
    been lost, and will emit done() (and also requestFinished() if a \c Put or
    \c Get request is in progress) with \c error set to \c true, and error()
    will return ConnectionError.

    This is particularly an issue for socket classes such as QTcpSocket that
    do not emit QIODevice::aboutToClose() when a \c disconnected() signal is
    emitted. In these cases, QObexPushService will not know that the
    transport has been disconnected. To avoid this, you can make the socket
    emit QIODevice::aboutToClose() when it is disconnected:

    \code
    // make the socket emit aboutToClose() when disconnected() is emitted
    QObject::connect(socket, SIGNAL(disconnected()), socket, SIGNAL(aboutToClose()));
    \endcode

    Or, if the socket can be discarded as soon as it is disconnected:

    \code
    // delete the socket when the transport is disconnected
    QObject::connect(socket, SIGNAL(disconnected()), socket, SLOT(deleteLater()));
    \endcode
