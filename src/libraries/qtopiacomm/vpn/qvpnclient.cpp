  \class QVPNClient
  \mainclass
  \brief The QVPNClient class abstracts data and state of a virtual private network.

  An instance of a QVPNClient can be created by using \l QVPNFactory. Qtopia currently 
  supports OpenVPN only. New VPN implementations must subclass this abstract class.
  
  Each VPNClient instance operates in one of the follwoing two modes:
  \list
    \o Client mode - 
        This mode is the most common way of using a QVPNClient object. Any Qtopia application
        that obtains a QVPNClient instance via QVPNFactory::create() will create such an object.
        Essentially the return instance acts as a thin wrapper that forwards the VPN requests
        to the QtopiaVpnManager.
    \o Server mode - 
        Only the QtopiaVpnManager can create such a QVPNObject instance. It performs the actual
        VPN operations by making the appropriate calls to the root file system.
  \endlist

  Every VPN can be identified via a unique identifier returned by id(), has a name() and a type().
  The VPN configuration can be changed via configure(). connect() will establish 
  the VPN connection. Once the VPN has been started its
  state() will change from \c{QVPNCLient::Disconnected} to \c{QVPNClient::Pending} 
  and eventually to \c{QVPNClient::Connected}. Each state change is indicated via the 
  connectionStateChanged() signal. If an error occurs during the startup period the user 
  can obtain a human-readable string describing the nature of the error.

  If the user decides to delete a VPN connection cleanup() should be called to remove any
  configuration file that has been created previously. By default Qtopia saves VPN
  configuration files in \c{$HOME/Applications/Netork/vpn}.

  Qtopia applications usually obtain client mode instances of QVPNClient. In this mode
  all request are forwarded to the QtopiaVpnManager which keeps a reference to a
