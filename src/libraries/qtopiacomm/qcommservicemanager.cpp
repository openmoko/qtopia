    \class QCommServiceManager
    \inpublicgroup QtBaseModule

    \brief The QCommServiceManager class provides a method to discover the active communications services and interfaces.

    Each service has a unique name, such as \c{GSM}, \c{VoIP}, etc.  Within
    each service is a list of interfaces for functionality areas, which have
    names such as QNetworkRegistration, QSMSSender, etc.

    Interface names correspond to class names elsewhere in the Qt Extended Communications and Telephony API's.  To use an interface, the caller
    creates an instance of the corresponding class.  The caller can specify
    an explicit service name, if more than one service implements the same
    interface, or leave the service name empty to use the default service
    for that interface.

    See the documentation for QAbstractIpcInterface for more information on
    writing and using interface classes.
