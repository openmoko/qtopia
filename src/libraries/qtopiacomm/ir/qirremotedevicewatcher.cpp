    \class QIrRemoteDeviceWatcher

    \brief The QIrRemoteDeviceWatcher class watches for remote devices.

    QIrRemoteDeviceWatcher can be used to wait for remote infrared devices
    to come into range, and notify the user.  Using this class, a system
    can alert the user that another infrared device is available for communication.

    the object's parent.

/*!
    Starts a watch for remote devices.  The \a ms parameter specifies the
    maximum time to watch, and the \a classes parameter specifies the
    filter of the types of devices we're interested in.

    NOTE: Due to the underlying system implementation, this function
    is blocking and will not return until a device has been found or the
    timeout has elapsed.

    The function will return false if the watch could not be started or
    an error occurred, and true otherwise. In case a new device was
    found within the specified timeout, the deviceFound() signal will
    be emitted and this function will return true.

    This function is designed to be called repeatedly in a loop.  It is
    designed to be used as a low-power, passive watcher of remote
    devices, such that a user can be notified when a new device has come
    into range.
