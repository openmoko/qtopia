    \brief The QBluetoothPasskeyRequest class encapsulates a Bluetooth PIN request.

    The QBluetoothPasskeyRequest class encapsulates a passkey request received
    from the bluetooth system.  The request can be rejected, cancelled or
    accepted.  If it is accepted, a valid passkey must be provided.

    Constructs a QBluetoothPasskeyRequest.  The \a localDevice parameter
    specifies the local bluetooth adapter the request came in on.  This
    string should be in the form hciX, such that it can be passed
    to QBluetoothLocalDevice constructor. The \a remoteDevice parameter
    specifies the remote device being paired to.

    By default, the request is set to be rejected.
