    \inpublicgroup QtBluetoothModule

    \brief The QBluetoothAudioGateway class provides an interface to a Bluetooth Audio Gateway.
    \ingroup qtopiabluetooth

    The Bluetooth Audio Gateway usually has an audio device associated with it.  Clients can also control speaker and microphone volume of
    the device, connect and disconnect remote clients and find status
    information of the audio gateway.

    The QBluetoothAudioGateway is used to control the Headset and Handsfree
    profile implementations in Qtopia.  Both use a control RFCOMM channel
    and a SCO voice data channel.  This class should be used by client
    applications that wish to control the state of Handsfree / Headset
    implementations (e.g. a Bluetooth Audio settings application.)

    \sa QCommInterface

/*!
    Construct a new audio gateway object for \a service and attach
    it to \a parent.  The object will be created in client mode if
    \a mode is Client, or server mode otherwise.

    If \a service is empty, this class will use the first available
    service that supports bluetooth audio gateway.  If there is more
    than one service that supports bluetooth audio gateway, the caller
    should enumerate them with QCommServiceManager::supports()
    and create separate QBluetoothAudioGateway objects for each.
