    \mainclass
    \brief The QBluetoothRemoteDevice class represents a remote bluetooth device.

    This class holds various device attributes of the remote device.  These
    attributes are device address, device class, manufacturer, etc.  The most
    common source of all remote device information is the discovery process.
    This process must be initiated by using the
    QBluetoothLocalDevice::discoverDevices() method and hooking onto the
    appropriate signals.

    Please note that depending on the source that provided the
    QBluetoothRemoteDevice instance, some or all of the information might
    not be available.  In general, address, device major, device minor
    and service class attributes should always be available.  Other
    attributes might require a connection be established to the
    remote device, and thus might not be available.
    In this case, default constructed values will be
    returned.
