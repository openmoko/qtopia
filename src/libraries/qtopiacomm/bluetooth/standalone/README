This is a pre-release version of the Qtopia 4.3.0 
Bluetooth core library.  This version requires at least Qt 
version 4.3.0 to compile and run.  To compile the library use 
the configure script.  You can pass the --help option to 
configure to find out all available options.

This library can optionally depend on the Qtopia Obex library.  If
you have already installed this library, indicate its location to
configure by using the --with-qobex option

The easiest way to use the QtBluetooth library in your own project
is to use the pkg-config files that are created during the installation
process.
