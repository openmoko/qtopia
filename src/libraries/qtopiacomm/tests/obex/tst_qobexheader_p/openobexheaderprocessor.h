//==========================================


/*?
    The OpenObexHeaderProcessor class allows you to send an OBEX request
    from an OBEX client to an OBEX server, and examine the request that
    is received by the OBEX server.

    This is useful for getting the header values that are inserted into an
    obex_object_t for a client request. That is, there is no way to get the
    inserted header values once you have added them to an obex_object_t in
    a client request, so if you want to examine what was actually inserted,
    you will just have to send them through to an OBEX server and then look
    at the header values that come out at the server end.

    This isn't the ideal solution, since it relies on OpenOBEX to parse the
    headers correctly when it receives them on the server side, but it's
    really not worth writing another OBEX header parser just to do these tests.

    If it was possible to read *and* write headers on the same obex_object_t*
    object, this class would be completely unnecessary (at least for the
    header tests, anyway -- perhaps there are other uses for this class).

    To run an individual test:
    1. Call startNewRequest()
    2. Call one of the add...Header() functions
    3. Call run().
       To see the results (i.e. the headers that are received by the OBEX
       server), either get the results from the receivedHeaders() signal,
       or pass a list pointer to the run() function. If you pass the pointer,
       make sure you delete contents of the list when you are finished;
       HeaderValue::clearList() can do this for you.
