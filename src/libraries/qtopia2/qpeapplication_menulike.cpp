  If \a b is true sets the dialog \a diag to have Menu Like behaviour when executed.
  Otherwise sets dialog to have default dialog behaviour.

  Menu Like dialogs typically have a single list of options, and
  should accept the dialog when the select key is pressed on the appropriate item,
  and when a mouse/stylus is used to click on an item - just like menus.
  Menu Like dialogs should only have one widget accepting key focus.
  
  By marking a dialog as Menu Like Qtopia will map the Back key to reject the dialog
  and will not map any key to accept the dialog - you must do that yourself.

  The default dialog behaviour is to include a cancel menu option in the context
  menu to reject the dialog and to map the Back key to accept the dialog.

  Only modal dialogs can be Menu Like.
