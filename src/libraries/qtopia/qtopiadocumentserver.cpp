    \brief The QtopiaDocumentServer class provides an instance of the Qt Extended Document Server.

    The Qt Extended Document Server provides applications with a mechanism to interact with the
    \l{Document System}{Qt Extended Document System} without having direct access to the document databases or
    even the file system.  A single instance of the document server runs in a server process, and client
    applications connect to this server in order to gain access to the functionality provided by the document
    system API.

    The document server runs multiple threads and should be shut down before being destroyed in order to allow
    the threads to exit cleanly.  A shut down can be initiated with the shutdown() slot, and the shutdownComplete()
    signal will be emitted when this is complete.
*/

    Constructs a new Qt Extended document server with the parent \a parent.

    Only one instance of the document server should ever exist at once across all Qt Extended applications.
