  \class ContextBar contextbar.h
  \brief The ContextBar class allows the context label in the phone
  context bar to be set.

  ContextBar is only available in the Qtopia phone edition.  It is
  used to set the text in the context bar to describe the action
  performed when pressing the associated context button.  Keep in
  mind that not all phones have soft keys and therefore may not have
  a visible context bar.  The application should be useable without
  soft key shortcuts.

  The context labels are updated whenever a widget gains or loses focus
  or their modal editing state changes.  Therefore, the labels should
  be set for each widget that may gain focus, and will respond to a
  context key.  The standard Qt and Qtopia widgets
  set the labels appropriately, so this is usually only necessary for
  custom widgets.

  The rule for determining what label is displayed on the context bar and
  where the key events are delivered is:

\list
  \i If the current focus widget has claimed the key, then the corresponding
  context label is shown.
  \i Otherwise, the widget's parent, grandparent and so on may set the label.
  \i If the focus widget has not claimed the key and an ancestor has, then
  the key event will be sent directly to the ancestor.
\endlist

  ContextBar labels specify both a pixmap and a text label.  Currently,
  Qtopia Phone Edition will always use the pixmap rather than text.  The
  text label must still be provided because future versions of Qtopia
  Phone Edition may allow the user to choose to view text labels.

  ContextBar is only available in the Qtopia Phone Edition.
