    \class QIMActionDescription
    \mainclass
    \preliminary
    \brief The QIMActionDescription class provides a way to define a QAction for a QtopiaInputMethod in the QSoftMenuBar QMenu.

    The menu in which QtopiaInputMethod actions will eventually displayed will
    typically be in a different process from the input method itself
    (which runs in the server).
    In order to avoid confusion, the simple QIMActionDescription is used
    rather than QActions on this side.

    The \a label attribute is used as the label of the final \l QAction.

    the \a iconFileName argument is a QString, and is used to find the icon
    for the action.  Note that the file name must be fully qualified, as it
    will not necessarily be called with the same environment as the
    inputmethod.

    The \a id attribute will be passed back to the input method via
    \c menuActionActivated(), in order to differentiate different actions,
    so the id field must be unique for each action in an input-method.

    \bold {Note:} 0 is reserved for an unknown or unrecognised menu actions,
    and negative id values are reserved for system menus.  Using these values
    is not recommended.

    IMActionDescriptions should be created on the heap.
    The server expects lists of pointers to QIMActionDescriptions, and will
    delete them when it is finished with them.  If constructing the
    QIMActionDescription is expensive, the copy constructor
    is very fast, and can be used safely.

  \class QtopiaInputMethod
  \mainclass
    \brief The QtopiaInputMethod class describes the minimum interface that an input method plug-in must provide.

    Input Methods may be added to Qtopia via plug-ins.  In
    order to write an input method plug-in you must create an
    interface for your plug-in by deriving from the
    QtopiaInputMethod class.

    At a minimum you will need to implement the methods name(),
    identifier(), version(), state(), properties(), icon()
    and reset().

    Pop-up input methods that need to show a widget on the
    screen can do so by overriding inputWidget().

    Filtering input methods that need to filter application pen
    or keyboard events can do so by overriding inputModifier()

/*!
  \enum QtopiaInputMethod::Properties

  The Properties flags describe how the input method behaves and under
  what conditions it should be loaded.

  \value RequireMouse
    The input method should not be loaded if no pen input is
    available.
  \value RequireKeypad
    The input method should not be loaded if no phone keypad
    is available.  A phone keypad consists of 0-9, * and # keys.
  \value InputModifier
    The input method can filter device pen and key events.
  \value InputWidget
    The input method provides a popup widget that receives input
  \value DockedInputWidget
    The input method's popup widget should be docked to the bottom of the screen, and other windows should be resized to allow for it's space when it is visible.  Note that DockedInputWidget implies InputWidget, and that the input method's input widget should be defined if this property is set (Setting the InputWidget property as well will not do any harm, but is not necessary)
  \value InteractiveIcon
    The icon representing the input method is interactive.  It
    can be clicked or will animate to show the mode of the
    input method.
  \value MenuItem
    The input method menu adds an item to the softkey context menu.
    If this value is set, the input method must also implement the menuActionToDuplicate() function that returns a QAction that is to copied for the menu.
    Additionally, the input method must respond to the menuActionActivated, as the supplied
    action will not receive events (it is only used as a model to copy).
    The input method can respond by either by implementing
    menuActionActivated in a subclass, or by connecting it somewhere else for processing.

  This is the primary communication channel from the server to the

  input widget requires to \a hint.  It must be implemented in Input
  Method plugins.

  If \a restricted is true
  the widget only accepts one kind of input and input method
  should disable any mode switching.  For example, the
  home screen Qtopia might set the hint to be restricted
  to phone numbers.

  an empty hint is used to indicate that input is not needed for the
  current focused widget- the Input Method should deactivate.

  Common hints are
  words  - Dictonary words such as some notes
  text - Names, passwords etc.
  extended - text with extensions for additional character sets
  number - 0-9
  phone - Phone numbers, 0-9 plus phone control codes such as 'p' 'x' or 'w'.

  Application may also define custom hints, such as email to
  describe an email address.  Input methods should provide
  reasonable default behavior for hints they do not recognize.

    activations, as the Softkey Menu has separate copies of the QAction,

void QtopiaInputMethod::menuActionActivated(int data){Q_UNUSED(data)};


/*!
    Implement this function in a derived class to return a description of
    the menu that should be installed on the input methods behalf.

    This function is called by Qtopia when the input methods menu is shown,
    or when the inputmethod emits stateChanged(), in order to construct the
    softkey menu entries for the input method.

    If the list contains only a single item, the server interprets this as a
    single menu item, and softkey puts it in its top-level menu, and returns
    its id when it is activated.

    If the list contains more than one item, the server interprests the first
    as the icon and label for a menu item in the top level softkey menu, and
    subsequent items as members of that submenu.  Note that in this case the
    first item will become a menu, and will not be triggerable, so its id will
    never be sent back to the IM.

    Each IMAction description includes an id to identify the action, a
    user-visible label, and the filename of the icon used for the action.
    Note that the icon will usually be instantiated from a different process
    that could have a different environment from the inputmethod, so the file
    name must be fully qualified.

    The default implementation returns an empty list, which will result in
    no menu actions being added on behalf of the input method.
