    \inpublicgroup QtLocationModule
    \ingroup whereabouts
    \brief The QWhereabouts class is a base class for providing regular updates about one's global position, and other related information, at a particular point in time.

    Call QWhereaboutsFactory::create() to get a QWhereabouts object, then
    call startUpdates() or requestUpdate() to receive positional data through the
    updated() signal.

    An example:

    \quotefromfile whereabouts/simpledemo/main.cpp
    \skipto class SimpleLocationDemo
    \printuntil };


    \section1 Subclassing QWhereabouts

    When startUpdates() or requestUpdate() is first called, a QWhereabouts subclass
    instance should change state to QWhereabouts::Initializing. If
    initialization succeeds, the state should change to
    QWhereabouts::Available, and then to QWhereabouts::PositionFixAcquired
    once a position fix is acquired and updates are possible. Otherwise, if
    initialization fails, the state should return to
    QWhereabouts::NotAvailable.

    Note that updated() should only be emitted while the state is
    QWhereabouts::PositionFixAcquired, and the provided update should always
    have valid date & time and coordinate values. Receivers of the signal should
    be able to assume that the provided update is valid without additional
    verification.

    Subclasses can call emitUpdated() to set the value of lastUpdate() and
    emit updated().

/*!
    \enum QWhereabouts::UpdateMethod
    This enum defines the methods that may be used to calculate and retrieve
    the information to provide a QWhereaboutsUpdate.

    \value AssistedUpdate Position data is calculated using assistance data from an AGPS module. (This is generally used to obtain faster and more accurate fixes.)
    \value NetworkBasedUpdate The position data is calculated by a remote server.
    \value TerminalBasedUpdate The position data is calculated by the terminal (i.e. the mobile device).
*/

/*!
    \enum QWhereabouts::State
    This enum defines the possible states for a whereabouts object.

    \value NotAvailable Positional data cannot be retrieved. This is the
    default state.
    \value Initializing The object is in the initialization stage. It will change to the Available state when it is successfully initialized.
    \value Available The object is able to receive position data, but it is not currently able to provide position updates as there is no position fix.
    \value PositionFixAcquired A position fix has been acquired and position updates can now be provided.

    becomes available.
