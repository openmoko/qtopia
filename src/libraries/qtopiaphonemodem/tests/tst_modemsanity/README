The "modemsanity" test checks that the GSM modem is acting in a reasonably
sane manner with respect to common telephony operations.  It will report
deviations from the behavior that Qtopia expects.  Such deviations will
typically need to be addressed in the modem vendor plugin.

By default, the phone simulator is checked for sanity.  To test an actual
modem, the "Settings/Trolltech/ModemSanity.conf" file must be provided to
configure the tests to be performed.  The following example demonstrates
how a wavecom modem might be configured for testing:

    [Modem]
    Device=/dev/ttyS0:115200
    Vendor=wavecom
    Multiplexing=true

    [Security]
    Pin=1234
    Pin2=4321

    [Operator]
    Name=Foobar

Modem/Device
    Name of the serial device to use to connect to the modem.
    Default is "sim:localhost".

Modem/Vendor
    Name of the vendor, which indicates which multiplexer and
    phonevendor plugins to load.  Use an empty string to auto-detect.
    Default is an emtpy string.

Modem/Multiplexing
    Set to true or false to indicate whether multiplexing should
    be used on the modem.  Default is true.

Security/Pin
    Value to use when the modem requests SIM PIN.  Default is empty,
    indicating that no SIM PIN is expected.

Security/Pin2
    Value to use when the modem requests SIM PIN2.  Default is empty,
    indicating that no SIM PIN2 is expected.

Operator/Name
    Name of the network operator that is expected upon network registration.
    The default value of empty indicates that the operator name should not
    be checked.
