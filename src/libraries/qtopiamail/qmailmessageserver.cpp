    \preliminary
    \brief The QMailMessageServer class provides signals and slots which implement a convenient
    interface for communicating with the MessageServer process via IPC.

    \ingroup messaginglibrary

    Qt Extended messaging applications can send and receive messages of various types by
    communicating with the external MessageServer application.  The MessageServer application
    is a separate process, communicating with clients via inter-process messages.  
    QMailMessageServer acts as a proxy object for the server process, providing an
    interface for communicating with the MessageServer by the use of signals and slots 
    in the client process.  It provides Qt signals corresponding to messages received from 
    the MessageServer application, and Qt slots which send messages to the MessageServer 
    when invoked.

    For most messaging client applications, the QMailServiceAction objects offer a simpler
    interface for requesting actions from the messageserver, and assessing their results.

    Note: the functions performed by the message server and the interface to them provided
    by the QMailMessageServer class are expected to change in a future release of Qt Extended,
    to provide a finer-grained interface for communicating with external services.

    \section1 New Messages

    When a client initiates communication with the MessageServer, the server informs the
    client of the number and type of 'new' messages, via the newCountChanged() signal.
    'New' messages are those that arrive without the client having first requested their
    retrieval.  The client may choose to invalidate the 'new' status of these messages;
    if the acknowledgeNewMessages() slot is invoked, the count of 'new' messages is reset
    to zero for the nominated message types.  If the count of 'new' messages changes while
    a client is active, the newCountChanged() signal is emitted with the updated information.

    \section1 Sending Messages

    To send messages, the client should construct instances of the QMailMessage class
    formulated to contain the desired content.  These messages should be stored to the
    mail store, then submitted for transmission by their QMailMessageId values, via the send()
    slot.  The MessageServer will determine how to transmit each message by inspecting
    the account associated with the message.

    If the MessageServer application succeeds in sending a message, the messageSent()
    signal is emitted to notify the client.  After transmission has been attempted for
    each message in the list, the sendCompleted() signal is emitted; any messages
    for which a messageSent() signal was not emitted were not successfully transmitted.

    After a send operation is initiated, the MessageServer emits the sendTotal() signal
    to indicate the approximate extent of the transmission effort.  As progress is made
    in performing the transmission operation, the sendProgress() signal is repeatedly
    emitted to report the progress toward completion of the operation.

    \section1 Retrieving Messages

    To retrieve messages, the client should invoke the retrieve() slot with the identifier
    for the account to retrieve new messages for.  If new messages are discovered, the
    messageRetrieved() signal is emitted for each message.  After retrieval has been
    attempted for all new messages, the retrievalCompleted() signal is emitted.

    After a retrieval operation is initiated, the MessageServer emits the retrievalTotal()
    signal to indicate the approximate extent of the retrieval effort.  As progress is made
    in performing the retrieval operation, the retrievalProgress() signal is repeatedly
    emitted to report the progress toward completion of the operation.

    \section2 Partial Retrieval

    If the message type supports partial retrieval (such as with POP or IMAP email
    messages), the partialMessageRetrieved() signal is emitted for each message once it
    has been partially retrieved.  After all new messages have been partially retrieved,
    the partialRetrievalCompleted() signal is emitted.

    \section2 Completing Partial Retrievals

    The client must invoke the completeRetrieval() operation in response to receiving the
    partialRetrievalCompleted() signal, to complete the retrieval operation.  A client may
    also invoke the completeRetrieval() slot without first performing a retrieval operation.
    If the list of messages to complete is empty, no further retrieval action will be taken.
    For any messages contained in the list, the MessageServer will attempt to retrieve the
    remainder of the message.  If the message whose retrieval is requested cannot be found on
    the external server, the mail store message record is updated to contain the \c Removed 
    status flag.  After retrieval completion has been attempted for all requested messages, 
    the retrievalCompleted() signal is emitted.

    \section2 Folder Retrieval

    It is possible to retrieve only the folder structure of an account rather than the
    messages contained by the folders, by invoking retrieve() retrieve slot with the 
    \c foldersOnly option set to true.  When the folder retrieval operation is complete,
    it is not necessary to invoke the completeRetrieval() operation.

    \section1 Cancellation

    In order to cancel an operation previously initiated, the client can invoke the
    cancelTransfer() slot.

    \section1 Server Status

    As the MessageServer application performs the operations requested of it, it indicates
    the tasks it is performing by emitting the statusChanged() signal.  If it encounters
    an error that prevents an operation from being performed, the errorOccurred() signal
    is emitted.
