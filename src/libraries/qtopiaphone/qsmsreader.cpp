    \class QSMSReader
    \mainclass
    \brief The QSMSReader class provides access to the incoming SMS message store on the modem device.

    \ingroup telephony

    The modem scans for new messages at start up and whenever a new message
    indication is received from the modem.  It will then update unreadCount(),
    unreadList(), usedMessages(), and totalMessages() to indicate the current
    state of the incoming SMS message store.

    The messageCount() signal is emitted when these values change, especially for
    new messages.  The unreadCountChanged() signal will be emitted whenever the
    number of unread messages changes, which could be when a new message arrives,
    or when the count is reset with setUnreadCount().

    SMS reading applications, such as \c qtmail, access the message store by
    calling check().  The QSMSReader class will respond with a messageCount()
    signal once the store is ready to be read.  The SMS reading application then
    calls firstMessage() to fetch the first message in the store.  The QSMSReader
    class will respond with a fetched() signal containing the message.  If the
    \c id parameter of fetched() is empty, then the list has terminated.
    Otherwise, the SMS reading application can call nextMessage() to read the
    next message; and so on.

    The deleteMessage() function can be used to delete a message from the
    incoming SMS message store.

    The setUnreadCount() function is used by the \c qpe server to reset
    unreadCount() after power up to the state it had before shutdown.
    It is also used by SMS reading applications like \c qtmail to reset
    the count to zero once all new messages have been processed.

    Some special SMS messages are not delivered via QSMSReader.  These are
    WAP push messages and SMS datagrams that are dispatched as soon as they
    arrive.  See QSMSMessage::destinationPort() for more information on how
    these types of messages are dispatched.
