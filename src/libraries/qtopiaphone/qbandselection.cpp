    \class QBandSelection
    \inpublicgroup QtTelephonyModule

    \brief The QBandSelection class provides an interface to select a GSM band for the phone to operate on.

    Bands are identified by string identifiers such as the following:

    \table
    \row \o \c{GSM 850} \o GSM at 850 MHz
    \row \o \c{GSM 900} \o GSM at 900 MHz
    \row \o \c{GSM 1800} \o DCS at 1800 MHz
    \row \o \c{GSM 1900} \o PCS at 1900 MHz
    \row \o \c{Dual 900/1800} \o Dual 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands
    \row \o \c{Dual 850/1900} \o Dual 950 MHz and 1900 MHz bands
    \endtable

    Telephony services should report dual bands separately from the
    single constituent bands, to allow the user to select either a
    specific band, or one of a set of supported bands.

    Not all modems support band selection.  The available() method should
    be used by client applications to determine if band selection is possible.

    \sa QCommInterface
    \ingroup telephony
*/

/*!
    Construct a new band selection object for \a service and attach
    it to \a parent.  The object will be created in client mode if
    \a mode is Client, or server mode otherwise.

    If \a service is empty, this class will use the first available
    service that supports band selection.  If there is more
    than one service that supports band selection, the caller
    should enumerate them with QCommServiceManager::supports()
    and create separate QBandSelection objects for each.

    \sa QCommServiceManager::supports()
