    \class QCallBarring
    \mainclass
    \brief The QCallBarring class provides access to the call barring settings on a GSM phone.

    The functionality in this class is implemented in accordance with the
    Call Barring supplementary service described in 3GPP TS 02.88.

    This service makes it possible for a mobile subscriber to have barring of
    certain categories of outgoing calls according to a barring type which
    is selected from a set of one or more barring types chosen at provision time
    and is valid for all outgoing calls, or just those associated with a specific
    call class (voice, data, etc).

    The current state of the call barring service is retrieved using the
    requestBarringStatus() function.  The state of the call barring service
    is changed using the setBarringStatus() function.  An entire group of
    barred calls can be unlocked with unlockAll(), unlockAllIncoming(),
    and unlockAllOutgoing().
