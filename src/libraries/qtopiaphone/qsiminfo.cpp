    \class QSimInfo
    \inpublicgroup QtTelephonyModule

    \brief The QSimInfo class provides information about a SIM's identity.
    \ingroup telephony

    The identity of the SIM can be retrieved with the identity() method.
    If the identity is not yet known, identity() will return an empty string.
    The inserted() and removed() signals can be used to track SIM's as they
    are inserted and removed.

    At system start up and just after a modem reset, the SIM identity may not
    be available immediately even if a SIM is physically present in the modem.
    Client applications should monitor the inserted() signal to be notified
    when the SIM identity has been positively determined.

    If the modem eventually determines that there is no SIM present at all,
    the notInserted() signal will be emitted.  Note that some modems cannot
    tell the difference between a missing SIM and a SIM which is not yet
    ready for use, so the notInserted() signal may not be reliable.  It is
    the responsibility of modem vendor plug-ins to correctly implement
    the notInserted() feature.
*/

/*!
    Construct a new SIM information object for \a service and attach
    it to \a parent.  The object will be created in client mode if
    \a mode is Client, or server mode otherwise.

    If \a service is empty, this class will use the first available
    service that supports SIM information.  If there is more
    than one service that supports SIM information, the caller
    should enumerate them with QCommServiceManager::supports()
    and create separate QSimInfo objects for each.

    cache is up to date or if it needs to be reloaded because the

    \fn void QSimInfo::notInserted()

    Signal that is emitted when the modem detects that there is no
    SIM inserted because the \c{AT+CIMI} command returned an error
    return code of 10.  An inserted() signal may be received after
    this signal if a SIM is inserted later.

    Note that it is possible for identity() to return an empty string
    during initialization even if there is a SIM inserted, so it is
    not a reliable indicator of a missing SIM.  The notInserted()
    signal is more reliable.
