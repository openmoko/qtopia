    \class QSupplementaryServices
    \mainclass
    \brief The QSupplementaryServices class provides access to structured and unstructured supplementary services within GSM networks.
    \ingroup telephony

    Structured supplementary service data can be sent to the network with
    sendSupplementaryServiceData() and unstructured supplementary service
    data can be sent with sendUnstructuredData().

    As structured and unstructured supplementary service data is received
    from the network, the outgoingNotification(), incomingNotification(),
    and unstructuredNotification() signals will be emitted.

    If there is an ongoing unstructured supplementary service session in
    progress, it can be canceled with cancelUnstructuredSession().

    \sa QCommInterface
*/

/*!
    Construct a new supplementary services object for \a service and attach
    it to \a parent.  The object will be created in client mode if
    \a mode is Client, or server mode otherwise.

    If \a service is empty, this class will use the first available
    service that supports supplementary services.  If there is more
    than one service that supports supplementary services, the caller
    should enumerate them with QCommServiceManager::supports()
    and create separate QSupplementaryServices objects for each.
