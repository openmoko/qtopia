    \class QAdviceOfCharge
    \mainclass
    \brief The QAdviceOfCharge class provides advice of charge information about a user's phone account.

    The 3GPP TS 02.86 Advice of Charge supplementary service provides the phone with the
    information to produce an estimate of the cost of the service used.  This telephony
    interface only applies to GSM-style mobile telephone networks.

    Charges are indicated for the call, or calls, in progress when mobile originated or
    for the roaming leg only when mobile terminated.  Any charges for non-call related
    transactions, and for certain supplementary services, such as Call Forwarding are
    not indicated.

    The phone will receive at the beginning of each call (and as necessary during the call) a
    message, the Charge Advice Information.  This message contains the elements which
    together define the rate at which the call is to be charged, time dependence,
    data dependence and for unit increments.  The message is delivered to client
    applications via the currentCallMeter() signal in this class.

    The charge information is reported in \i units, which vary depending upon the
    operator and the user's home currency.  When the client calls requestPricePerUnit(),
    the service will respond with a pricePerUnit() signal to report the international
    currency name (for example, \c USD, \c EUR, \c AUD, \c GBP, \c DEM, etc)
    and the price per unit.

    In addition to the call-specific call meter, there is an accumulated call
    meter that keeps track of all calls made since the last time the meter was
    reset with requestAccumulatedCallMeter().

    The client can set a maximum accumulated call meter value with
    setAccumulatedCallMeterMaximum().  When the accumulated call meter is within
    30 seconds of expiry, the callMeterMaximumWarning() signal will be emitted to
    warn the user that their account is almost depleted.
