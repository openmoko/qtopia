    \class QPhoneCallManager
    \mainclass
    \brief The QPhoneCallManager class provides access to the phone's call list.
    \ingroup telephony

    The current list of calls in the system can be inspected with QPhoneCallManager,
    and new outgoing calls can be created with create().

    The calls() method returns a list of all active calls in the system.  Active
    calls are those that are dialing, incoming, connected, or on hold.  Idle and
    dropped calls are not included in the list.

    New calls are added to the call list whenever a client application
    creates a call with create(), or when an incoming call is detected
    by the back-end telephony services.  The newCall() signal is
    emitted when either of these conditions occurs.

    As calls change state, the statesChanged() signal is emitted,
    providing a list of all calls affected by the state change.
    More than one call may be affected by a state change in cases where
    an entire group of calls are hung up, put on hold, or swapped with
    an active call group.

    State changes on individual calls can be tracked using QPhoneCall::connectStateChanged(),
    but this does not allow group operations to be tracked atomically.  The statesChanged()
    signal allows atomic tracking of group operations.

    The methods callTypes() and services() can be used to find the telephony
    handlers in the system, so that higher-level applications can choose
    the most appropriate type of call.

    For an example that demonstrates the use of QPhoneCallManager, see
    \l {Tutorial: Making Phone Calls}{Making Phone Calls}.  Also see the
    documentation for QPhoneCall.
