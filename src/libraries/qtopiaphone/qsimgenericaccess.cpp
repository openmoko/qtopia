    \class QSimGenericAccess
    \inpublicgroup QtTelephonyModule

    \brief The QSimGenericAccess class provides an interface to send commands directly to a SIM.
    \ingroup telephony

    Use of this class usually results in an \c{AT+CSIM} command being sent to the modem.
    The commands must be in the format described in 3GPP TS 51.011.

    Sending generic access commands to a SIM bypasses the normal
    mechanisms that are used to access SIM files, SIM application toolkit,
    operator data, etc.  This class should therefore be used only for
    commands that are not already covered by other classes such as
    QSimFiles, QBinarySimFile, QRecordBasedSimFile, and QSimToolkit.

    \sa QSimFiles, QBinarySimFile, QRecordBasedSimFile, QSimToolkit

/*!
    Construct a new SIM generic access object for \a service and attach
    it to \a parent.  The object will be created in client mode if
    \a mode is Client, or server mode otherwise.

    If \a service is empty, this class will use the first available
    service that supports SIM generic access.  If there is more
    than one service that supports SIM generic access, the caller
    should enumerate them with QCommServiceManager::supports()
    and create separate QSimGenericAccess objects for each.
