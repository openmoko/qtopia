    \class QCallSettings
    \inpublicgroup QtTelephonyModule

    \brief The QCallSettings class provides access to auxiliary settings in a GSM phone related to calls.
    \ingroup telephony

    Other classes such as QCallForwarding, QCallBarring, QNetworkRegistration,
    etc, are used for specific call settings that have rich interfaces.
    The QCallSettings class is for minor settings that don't require more
    than simple request and set methods.

/*!
    \enum QCallSettings::CallerIdRestriction
    This enum defines the states that the caller ID restriction service can be in.

    \value Subscription Caller ID restriction is according to the network operator's subscription preferences.
    \value Invoked Caller ID restriction is currently invoked.  That is, the
           caller ID information of the local party will not be sent during
           calls.
    \value Suppressed Caller ID restriction is currently suppressed.  That is,
           the caller ID information of the local party will be sent
           during calls.
*/

/*!
    \enum QCallSettings::CallerIdRestrictionStatus
    This enum defines the status of the caller ID restriction service within the network, indicating whether it can be modified or not.

    \value NotProvisioned The caller ID restriction service is not provisioned.
    \value Permanent The caller ID restriction service is provisioned in permanent mode and the local user cannot change it.
    \value Unknown The caller ID restriction state is currently unknown (e.g. no network).
    \value TemporaryRestricted The caller ID restriction service is provisioned in temporary restricted mode.
    \value TemporaryAllowed The caller ID restriction service is provisioned in temporary allowed mode.

    \enum QCallSettings::SmsTransport
    This enum defines the transport to be used for sending SMS messages.

    \value SmsTransportPD Use GPRS packet domain to send SMS messages.
    \value SmsTransportCS Use non-GPRS circuit switching to send SMS messages.
    \value SmsTransportPDPreferred Use GPRS packet domain if available, or non-GPRS circuit switched otherwise.
    \value SmsTransportCSPreferred Use non-GPRS circuit switching if available, or GPRS packet domain otherwise.
    \value SmsTransportUnavailable The modem does not support selecting an SMS transport.

    \value PresentationProvisioned Presentation of caller id has been provisioned by the network operator.
    \value PresentationUnknown Presentation status is unknown, probably because of no network service.
