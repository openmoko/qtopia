    \class QCellBroadcast
    \inpublicgroup QtTelephonyModule

    \brief The QCellBroadcast class provides access to cell broadcast messages on GSM networks according to 3GPP TS 03.41.
    \ingroup telephony

    The cell broadcast service permits a number of unacknowledged general
    messages to be broadcast to all receivers within a particular region.
    Cell broadcast messages are broadcast to defined geographical areas known
    as cell broadcast areas. These areas may comprise of one or more cells,
    or may comprise the entire network operator's coverage area.

    Cell broadcast messages contain a channel number which allows simple
    filtering to be performed at the modem to reduce the amount of traffic
    that the client phone software needs to deal with.  Client applications
    request the list of channels they are interested in with the
    setChannels() method.  As messages on the selected channels arrive,
    they are delivered to client applications using the broadcast() signal.

    \sa QCBSMessage, QCommInterface

/*!
    Construct a new cell broadcast handling object for \a service and attach
    it to \a parent.  The object will be created in client mode if
    \a mode is Client, or server mode otherwise.

    If \a service is empty, this class will use the first available
    service that supports cell broadcast.  If there is more
    than one service that supports cell broadcast, the caller
    should enumerate them with QCommServiceManager::supports()
    and create separate QCellBroadcast objects for each.
