    \inpublicgroup QtMediaModule

    \brief The Info class contains information on the type and characteristics of the
    media stream that this QMediaDevice produces.

    When the stream type is Raw - the dataSize member will indicate the
    complete size of the data available to the device, or -1 if the size is not
    available.

    When the stream type is PCM - the PCM data will have a frequency, sample
    size, and number of channels corresponding to the frequency, bitsPerSample
    and channels members. The expected volume of the data is set with the
    volume member.
*/

    \fn QMediaDevice::Info QMediaDevice::dataType() const;

    Return information about the Data produced by this QMediaDevice.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QMediaDevice::connectToInput(QMediaDevice* input);

    The device is being connected to the \a input to be used as a source of data.
    Returns true if the connection was successful; false otherwise.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QMediaDevice::disconnectFromInput(QMediaDevice* input);

    The QMediaDevice is being disconnected from \a input source of data.
