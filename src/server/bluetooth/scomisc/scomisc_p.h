/*
    This is a private subsystem of the Bluetooth Handsfree / Headset profile
    implementations.  It is meant to allow system integrators to access the
    raw voice data coming in on the SCO socket connection.

    System integrators can provide their own implementation that handles
    the necessary audio routing steps.  Since the most common scenario on
    phones is to have the audio routed over PCM, most devices do not
    actually need to perform any management, and these functions can be empty.

    See the greenphone integration for an example of this.  If software
    routing is required, an example implementation using the btsco kernel
    module is provided.  It is not supported and will not work in many situations.
*/

/*
    Sets the SCO socket file descriptor for handle.  Note that the sco_fd
    can be -1, in this case it is indicated that audio should not be routed
    to the bluetooth headset, otherwise audio should be routed.

    return true if the set operation succeeded, and false otherwise.

    Note that the sco_fd is a bare socket descriptor, you must perform
    all management yourself (e.g. you must notify the audio gateway that
    the socket has been closed for instance)

    See the greenphone scomisc integration for an example.
