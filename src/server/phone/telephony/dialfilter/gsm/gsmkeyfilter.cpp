    \class GsmKeyFilter
    \inpublicgroup QtCellModule
    \internal
    \brief The GsmKeyFilter class filters key sequences looking for GSM control actions.

    The GsmKeyFilter class filters key sequences looking for GSM control
    actions.  The following standard control actions are recognized by
    this class:

    \table
    \row \o \c{0 SEND}
         \o Set the busy state for a waiting call, or release the held calls.
    \row \o \c{1 SEND}
         \o Release the active calls.
    \row \o \c{1n SEND}
         \o Release only call \c{n}.
    \row \o \c{2 SEND}
         \o Swap the active and held calls.
    \row \o \c{2n SEND}
         \o Activate only call \c{n}, putting all others on hold.
    \row \o \c{3 SEND}
         \o Join the active and held calls into a multi-party conversation.
    \row \o \c{4 SEND}
         \o Join the active and held calls into a multi-party conversation
            and then detach the local user (i.e. transfer).
    \row \o \c{4*n SEND}
         \o Deflect the waiting call to the number \c{n}.
    \endtable

    Additional actions can be added with addAction().
  
    This class is part of the Qt Extended server and cannot be used by other Qt Extended applications.

/*!
    \enum GsmKeyFilter::Flag
    Flags that modify the filtering of keys for GSM control actions.

    \value Send The GSM \c SEND function has been selected.  Usually this
           is the call button on the keypad.
    \value Immediate The action should be taken immediately when the last
           character is matched.  This is for sequences such as \c{*#06#}
           which must activate when the final \c{#} is pressed.
    \value OnCall The digits were entered when there was an
           active or held call.
    \value Incoming The digits were entered when there was an incoming
           call that has not yet been accepted.
    \value BeforeDial The digits were encountered just before the dial
           attempt was made.  The digits may have originated from a dialer
           or from a contact.  This provides a last chance to intercept a
           string of digits before regular dialing occurs.
    \value TestOnly Test to see if the filter would suceed, but do not apply.
*/

/*!
    \enum GsmKeyFilter::ServiceAction
    Action types for supplementary services.

    \value Activate Request to activate a supplementary service.
    \value Deactivate Request to deactivate a supplementary service.
    \value Interrogate Interrogate the current state of a supplementary service.
    \value Registration Register for a supplementary service.
    \value Erasure Erase a supplementary service.
