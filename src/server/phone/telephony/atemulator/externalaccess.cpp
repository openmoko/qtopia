    \class ExternalAccess
    \inpublicgroup QtTelephonyModule
    \brief The ExternalAccess class starts the modem emulator on a serial port to allow external access via a serial cable.
    \ingroup QtopiaServer::Telephony

    Many modern phones have an external serial interface, which is used to
    connect to a computer for the purposes of data calls, FAX transmissions,
    or synchronization with desktop applications.  The \l{Modem Emulator}
    assists with supporting such interfaces.

    To enable the modem emulator to use an external serial interface,
    the \c Phone.conf file should be placed under the \c etc/default/Trolltech
    directory on the vendor system, with contents such as the following:

    \code
    [SerialDevices]
    ExternalAccessDevice=/dev/ttyS1:115200
    \endcode

    where \c{/dev/ttyS1} should be replaced with the name of the serial device
    to listen to, and \c{115200} should be replaced with the desired baud rate.

    If this option is configured, the modem emulator will be launched
    automatically once the phone server has been initialized.  If this
    option is not configured, then the modem emulator will only be launched
    when other components in the system request it (for example,
    Bluetooth hands-free kits).

    This class is part of the Qt Extended server and cannot be used by other Qt Extended applications.
