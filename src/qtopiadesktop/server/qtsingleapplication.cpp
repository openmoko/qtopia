    \class QtSingleApplication qtsingleapplication.h
    \brief The QtSingleApplication class provides an API to detect and
    communicate with running instances of an application.

    This class allows you to create applications that cannot have
    multiple instances running on the same machine for the same user.

    To use the QtSingleApplication class you must provide an ID string
    that it unique on the system you run the application on. Typical
    IDs are the name of the application and the application vendor, or
    a string representation of a \link QUuid UUID\endlink.

    The application should create the QtSingleApplication object very
    early in the startup phase, and try to send a message or call
    isRunning() to find out if an instance of this application is
    already running.

    If an instance is already running, this application instance
    should terminate. Otherwise the application should call
    initialize() immediately, and continue with the initialization of
    the application user interface before entering the event loop with
    exec(). The messageReceived() signal will be emitted when the
    application receives messages from another instance of the same
    application. If a message is received it might be helpful to the
    user to raise the application so that it becomes visible.

    Here's an example that shows how to convert an existing
    application to us QtSingleApplication. It is very simple and does
    not make use of all QtSingleApplication's functionality(see the
    examples for that).

    \code
    // Original
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
	QApplication app(argc, argv);

	MyMainWidget mmw;
	app.setMainWidget(&mmw);

	mmw.show();
	return app.exec();
    }

    // Single instance
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
	QtSingleApplication app("MySingleInstance", argc, argv);

	if (app.sendMessage("Do I exist?"))
	    return 0;

        app.initialize();

	MyMainWidget mmw;
	app.setMainWidget(&mmw);

	QObject::connect(&app, SIGNAL(messageReceived(QString)),
		&app, SLOT(activateMainWidget()));

	mmw.show();
	return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    Once this QtSingleApplication instance is destroyed(for example,
    when the user quits), when the user next attempts to run the
    application this instance will not, of course, be encountered.
