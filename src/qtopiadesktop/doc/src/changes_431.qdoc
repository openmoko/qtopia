\section1 Known issues

\list
\o Appointments starting and ending at midnight are mis-reported as all day events.
\o An obvious crash bug somehow made it through our QA process. Contact
   support-embedded@trolltech.com if you require the patch to correct this.
\o Records are being duplicated when synchronizing multiple times.
\o Tasks does not sync due to an error handling the low-level protocol.
\o Objects of an unexpected type returned from Outlook can cause problems. For example,
   a distribution list in the Contacts folder is not ignored and is accessed like a
   Contact, potentially causing problems.
\o Synchronization reports on items that were created in the previous sync transaction.
   This causes items created in Outlook to be duplicated at every sync.
\endlist
