To build the Qtopia Sync Agent installer you will need to do the following:

1) Install NSIS 2.0
2) Build Qtopia Sync Agent
3) Build the installer

Ensure any redistributable files required by your compiler (eg. msvcrtxx.dll)
are in %QPEDIR%\src\qtopiadesktop\dist\redist. For VC8 you must also provide
an appropriate manifest file.

Building the installer uses the makensi script:
   %QPEDIR%\bin\makensi

The installer will be placed in %QPEDIR%\src\qtopiadesktop\dist

You can add your own sections to the installer by passing -extra <file> to
makensi.
