=head1 NAME

Hash::Ordered - Remember the order in which you inserted in a hash.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Hash::Ordered;
    tie my %hash, 'Hash::Ordered';

    foreach my $key ('a' .. 'z') {
        $hash {$key} = 1;
    }

    print keys %hash;     # prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package allows you to retrieve the keys in the same order as they
were inserted. Note that if you assign to an already existing key in
the hash, the package does B<not> classify the key as new. If you want
that behaviour, delete the key first.

=head1 AUTHOR

This package was written by Abigail.

=head1 BUGS

The hash uses the keys as next/previous pointers in an embedded linked
list. If the keys are large, this is a memory waste; perhaps references
to the keys are better.
