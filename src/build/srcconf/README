srcconf
=======

srcconf is a software package which enables user friendly configuration of
software source code packages. srcconf is based on lxdialog and kconfig
(a.k.a. lkc) extracted from linux kernel 2.5.50.

srcconf should run on all POSIX operating systems (including Linux
and MS Windows with Cygwin installed).

Build and install instructions
------------------------------

1. Download and unpack srcconf sources.
2. Run `./configure --prefix=/usr`.
3. Run `make` and `make install`.

Running srcconf
---------------

To configure your software source code package please read documentation
for the package. In general, you should run either `conf', or `mconf', or
`qconf' (qconf is optional, requires qt) program with a parameter (this
parameter is dependent by configured package).

Note: `conf', `mconf', and `qconf' are only different front-ends for
srcconf (lkc) engine with different look, but with same results.
