<h1>System Info Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>

<a name=description>
</a>
<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
The System Info application shows information about the system.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
System Info allows the user to view the state of the running system
and various other information.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.

<ul>
<li><b>Resolving an error</b>
    <p>Something doesn't work quite right, so the user starts the
System Info application. She looks at the Memory view and sees that
there is plenty of free memory, then switches to the Storage view to
check that Internal Storage isn't full. Finally she switches to the
Version view to find the version of the system to submit a bug report.

<li><b>If the system is slow</b>
    <p>A bored product marketing manager is playing Asteroids, but the
    game feels slow. He fires up system info and switches to the CPU
    information view.  It shows that system CPU usage is low, so he knows
    that there is no other application using all the CPU. He then
    switches to the Memory view and sees that there is no free memory
    and very little cached memory.  The user therefore turns off
    fast-loading on his todo-list with 5000 items in it, and this
    frees up enough memory to make the game fast and responsive.

</ul>

<a name=features>
<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Memory info: Shows how much memory is used, buffered, cached or free.
<li>Storage inf: Shows how much space is left in internal storage and in
	    each of the removable media.
<li>CPU info: Shows how much of the CPU is being used by applications and
	      by the operating system.
<li>Version info: Shows the version number and vendor of Qtopia, the operating
		system and optionally other components.
</ul>

<a name=prerequisites>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
