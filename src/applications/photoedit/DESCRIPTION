The Pictures application allows the user to manage an image collection. A variety of image file formats are supported and the user is able to browse through their collection, view slide shows, view images close-up, adjust orientation, adjust brightness, and perform cropping. Once an image has been edited the user has the option of saving the new image by either creating a new image or overwriting the old image.
