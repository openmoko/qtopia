<h1>Calendar Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>

<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
The Calendar program helps the user manage their schedule.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
The Calendar program helps the user manage their schedule.  This includes timed
events such as meetings, day events such as birthdays, and multi-day events.
Also provided is the ability to have alarms for events and to specify a
recurrence pattern for the event.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.

<ul>
<li><b>Business person</b>
    <p>A businessman living in London is currently in Tokyo on a business trip.
    He has promised his wife that
    he will call her at home at 7pm every night. He receives a call from a customer in
    New York who says "can you meet me in Los Angeles, at 11am tomorrow". Examining his
    schedule, he can quickly see that he will be talking with his wife at that time,
    and replies "No, but I can meet you for an hour in New York at 1pm".
<li><b>Socialite</b>
    <p>A socialite has a World Wildlife Fund meeting on the first Friday
    of each month, a Greenpeace meeting every two weeks on the Wednesday
    and Thursday nights.  She is thinking of joining the National Rifle Association,
    which meets on the 13th of each month. She wants to know how many times
    in the year this will cause conflicts.
<li><b>Student</b>
    <p>A student enters his class schedule.  The lecturer in one subject
    announces that she is spending the last two weeks of May on her honeymoon,
    that the lectures for those weeks are cancelled and that her lectures
    in June will each be extended by an hour.
    The student modifies his schedule accordingly.
<li><b>Communication</b>
    <p>Bob is going to a concert in a few months.  He beams the details of
    the concert to his friend Betty who is also keen on going.
    (not implemented: Later, Betty looks up
    the concert online, adds more detail to her copy of the event, and emails
    the result back to Bob, who adds it into his calendar.)
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
   <li>Beaming: Send and receive events via beaming.
   <li>Recursion: Must be able to determin the pattern
	of user events in a defined period of time.
	<ul>
	    <li>Daily - every N days.
	    <li>Weekly - every N weeks, on days specified bye WEEKMASK
	    <li>Monthly Day - The Xth week of every N months,
			X being day of week and week of the month for 
			the first event in the series.
	    <li>Monthly End Day - The Xth last week of every N months,
			X being day of week and week of the month (from end of month)
			for the first event in the series.
	    <li>Monthly Date - The Xth day of the month every N months,
			X being the day of the month for the first event in 
			the series.
	    <li>Yearly Date - The Xth day of the Year every N years,
			X being the day of the year for the first event in 
			the series.
	</ul>
        For a week mask, the mask should describe a week starting on the
	starting date of the series.  Hence a mask of Wednesday, Saturday, Monday
	Should occur that Wednesday, the immidiately following Saturday, then the 
	immidiately following Monday.
    <li>Display: Should display information clearly, for day, week and month views.
	Should not show a time as blank if an event occurs in that time, and 
	accordingly should not show an event for a time if the event does not occur
	during that time.
    <li>Navigation: Should be easy and clear how to navigate between dates.  Shown
	Date must be clear at all times.
    <li>Alarms: Alarmed events should emit an alarm at the user specified time.
    <li>AllDay events: These events should not be affected by time-zone changes.
</ul>

<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )
