The Calendar application allows a user to plan their schedule. This includes the scheduling of timed events such as meetings, day events such as birthdays, and multi-day events such as workshops. The application also provides the facility to set alarms for events and to specify a pattern of repetition for events.
The default view shows the current day in one hour intervals.
