<h3>Each repeat pattern is correct at a frequency of 1, 2, and 3.</h3>
For each repeat type (or repeat type combination) should test that the pattern is
correct in each view for a frequency of 1, 2, or 3.  This includes the
"Gray" area of the month view.

<h3>Weekly repeat pattern</h3>
Weekly repeat patterns need to be tested starting on Saturdays, Sundays,
and some other day of the week.  For each of these should also test on
the combination of Saturdays, Sundays and some other day of the week.

<h3>Alarms should work with respect to timezone and repeats</h3>
Alarm testing should include both timezone shifted events and
recurring events on the initial occurrance and following occurances.

<h3>Beaming of an event</h3>
Beaming of events should both send and recieve all corresponding fields
as well as result in a sensible representation on the destination device.

Because of various feature patterns, not all recurring patterns should be
expected to match excactly on a send or receive.

<h3>AllDay events time-zone independent</h3>
All day events should not change date when changing the locale of the device,
and should have different representations in the views from events which are not
all day events.

<h3>Midnight events</h3>
Events should be tested over end of day, end of week and end of month boundries.
This includes events that cross boundries in their local timezone and ones that
only cross boundries in alturnate timezones.  Testing should be done with
both allday and non-allday events.
