<h1>Calculator Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>

</a>
<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
The calculator allows flexible numerical calculation through plugins.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
The calculator allows numerical calculations. User-defined types,
functions and interfaces are provided through a plugin interface.
Many components are supplied with the library, including integer,
double and fraction data types, basic operations, and common
calculator user-interface elements.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.

<ul>
<li><b>Shopper</b>
    <p>A shopper adds prices in the supermarket as she puts goods
    into her trolley, in order to keep track of the running total.
    When she has finished choosing goods, she calculates tax due on the
    total.
<li><b>Student</b>
    <p>A student uses an emulated TI interface that he is familiar with
    to solve fractional problems.
<li><b>Engineer</b>
    <p>An engineer writes a plugin to help him calculate stresses on
    a bridge he is designing. The interface is customised to suit
    the typical functions he needs to access.
<li><b>Familiar</b>
    <p>User throws away his old dedicated calculator, and uses the Qtopia
    calculator without having to learn anything new. He even uses his
    fingers poking at the device's touchscreen rather than a stylus.
</ul>

<a name=features>
<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Backspace: delete last character of the current number
<li>Double operations: various mathematical operations with double precision
<li>Common user interface elements: standard input widgets available as part of the library
<li>Memory operations: store and add, clear, retrieve
<!--
Framework automatically converts data types to match operations.
--!>
<li>Most-recently-used plugin: MRU plugin is active when the calculator is restarted.
<li>Braces: change operator precedence
<li>Error message: standard, translated error messages

</ul>

<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
