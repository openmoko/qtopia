<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
 -->
<ul>
<li><b>Listen To Music</b>
    <p>A commuter while waiting for her bus or train and during her commute is
    entertained by listening to music. She makes a selection of music which she
    can listen to continuously during her commute. She easily adjusts the
    volume to changes in surrounding noise levels.
<li><b>Watch News Clip</b>
    <p>A buisness man during his morning commute to work on the train
    watches a news report he has downloaded earlier. After he finishes
    watching it, he deletes it from his device.
<li><b>Watch Movie Preview</b>
    <p>A movie fan downloads a movie trailer to decide if she wishes to
    see that movie or not. She watches the trailer on the device and leaves
    it on the device to show to her friends to see if they also wish to
    see that movie.
</ul>
