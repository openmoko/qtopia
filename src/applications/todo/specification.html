<h1>Todo List Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>
-->

<a name=description>
</a>
<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
The Todo List application manages a set of tasks.

<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
This application is used for prioritizing tasks, recording due dates,
and recorded when and if each task is completed.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
 -->
<ul>
<li><b>What do I do now</b>
    <p>The user enters tasks into
	the Todo List as they are discovered,
	and some time later see them, perform some tasks,
	and record them as completed. The default view ordering assist
	answering the question "What do I do now?"
<li><b>Different hats</b>
    <p>The user has more than one responsibility - they are an employee
	and a parent. They use categories
	for Business and Personal to divide between work and home,
	and add a "Kids" category for items specifically about their children.
	At different times, they only want to see parts of their todo list,
	according to these categories so as to avoid being distracted.
<li><b>Progress report</b>
    <p>When preparing a progress report to superiors, the user is assisted
	by the list of tasks that have been completed since their last
	progress report.
<li><b>Delegator</b>
    <p>The big boss, buried in responsibility, delegates items from their
	todo list by walking around the office, zapping underlings with
	tasks using low-power infrared energy and other radiation.
</ul>

<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Storage: each event requires 100 bytes of storage plus
	UTF-8 string storage for the description, plus 16 bytes per category,
	plus 50 bytes if a due date is used.
<li>Memory: while running, each event requires 300 bytes of storage,
	plus UTF-16 string storage for the description, plus 80 bytes per category,
</ul>
