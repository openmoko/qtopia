<h1>Clock Specification</h1>


<!--
<h2>Specification goals</h2>
This specification:
<ol>
<li> Describes all of the end-user stories and interactions.
    (eg. the user can view a slide show of images from a digital camera).
<li> Lists all features, derived from end-user stories,
    in enough detail to allow the definition of
    tests for all features.
<li> Defines contraints and limitations on the application.
    (eg. can view image sizes as large as 1MB).
<li>Aides the developer on focusing on the most important aspects of
    the application and ensuring all important elements are completed.
</ol>

<a name=description>
</a>
<!-- A one-line description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing of image files.)
-->
The clock shows the time, a stopwatch and allows a daily alarm to be set.
<!-- A one-paragraph description of what this application is and does.
    This description is then duplicated in the .desktop Comment and
    the .control file description.

    (eg. The image viewer allows viewing and very minor editing
    of image files. It assists format conversion, beaming logos
    to phones, captioning, etc.)
-->
<p>
The clock provides three functions: 1. Displays the current date and time.
2. Provides a stopwatch. 3. Allows a daily alarm to be set and enabled/disabled.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
</a>
<!-- Describe real-world stories. Implicit in these use cases is
	"these things are easy to do".
    (eg.
	Roving News Reporter

	The journalist/cameraman takes photos with a digital camera,
	loads them into the PDAs via CF card, adjusts the contrast,
	blacks-out a license plate, adds a copyright caption, and
	emails the image and short story to Reuters.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
 -->
<ul>
<li><b>Viewing Date and Time</b>
    <p>While the PDA is in its cradle, the office worker uses it as a
       desktop clock.
<li><b>Jogger</b>
    <p>A jogger runs around a 400m track 6 times. He starts the stopwatch as
	he starts, and presses a button each time he rounds the track. He can
	observe the precise time taken for each lap.
<li><b>Setting Daily Alarm</b>
    <p>The traveller sets an alarm to wake him up at 5:30 each morning.
    <p>(not yet implemented: The traveller never wants to be woken on Saturday,
	Sunday, or Wednesday; the traveller can easily press a "Snooze" button
	to get a little more rest, but the alarm will sound again; he never
	misses getting woken)
</ul>

<a name=features>
<h2>Features</h2>
</a>
<!-- features are brief

    (eg. 
	* Slide show: view multiple images in sequence
	    * Configurable delay between images.
	    * Hardware-button-controlled stepping between images.
	* Big images: view larger-than-available-RAM images in some formats.
	* Formats: view JPEG, PNG, GIF format images.
	* Scribbling: draw black or white lines on images.
	* Save: in JPEG, PNG formats.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Clock: Display an analog clock, digital clock and the date in one view.
<li>Stopwatch: Display an analog and digital stopwatch timer.
    The digital timer has a resolution of 1/100 second.
    <ul>
    <li>Start/Stop: The [Select] hardware button must Start/Stop the stopwatch.
    </ul>
<li>Daily Alarm: Allows a daily alarm to be enabled/disabled and set.
    <ul>
    <li>Audible Alarm: When the alarm is activated an audible alarm must be
	sounded.
    <li>Visual Alarm: When the alarm is activated a dialog box must be shown
	with the alarm details.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<!--
    Describes unresolved limitations that cannot
    be shown within the features list.

    Describes memory and other requirements quantitatively.

    This is a short list, mainly intended as a "known bugs"
    list for missing features.

    (eg.
	* Stylus: required for Scribbling.
	* Memory: requires 250 bytes per event, plus content strings.
    )

    Note: TITLEs may be used as identifiers in bug reports.
-->

<ul>
<li>Alarm Server: requires a working alarm server for daily alarm function.
<li>Audible Alarm: requires speaker/buzzer.
</ul>
