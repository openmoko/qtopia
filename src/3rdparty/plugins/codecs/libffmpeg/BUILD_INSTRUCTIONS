IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
Compile this with the skiff compiler and not the embedix one.
(toolchain in /skiff/... instead of /opt/Embedix/...)
The embedix compiler sucks eggs at optimizaing the libraries code for speed.
To do this set TEAMBUILDER_CC_VERSION=2.95.2 and when working on optimizing anything
you will be certain that a different random compiler chosen by teambuilder isn't screwing
up your benchmarking.

While this is still in development, I don't want to check in all of ffmpeg yet.
Additionally ffmpeg haven't made an official release yet but one is expected soon.

If you would like to work on or test this plugin out as it is at the moment,
you simply need to run "cvs up" to grab the latest ffmpeg code from cvs, and then
run ./configure (for arm use './configure --cpu=armv4l --cross-prefix=arm-linux-')
and then run make in the libavcodec and libav directories.

I'll check it in when they make an official release. For now the snapshot they have on their
web site (ffmpeg.org) may be better than using their cvs code as at the moment it is broken.
Otherwise you'll need to to a reverse diff back to 2002/08/31 using:
cvs diff -D "2002/08/31" > d.diff ; patch -R -p0 < d.diff

Then in Qtopia's top level Makefile add to COMPONENTS "3rdparty/plugins/codecs/libffmpeg"
and reconfigure Qtopia and run make. The libffmpegplugin should be built and linked together
with libavcodec and libav and ready to run.

Currently there are some issues with the audio decoding which I am working on, but
it appears that the library is capable of decoding mpeg streams very efficently such
that it won't ever need to skip frames which will be quite an improvement over libmpeg3.
There are also issues with controlling the decoding to seek forwards and backwards in
a movie, but that should be resolvable.
