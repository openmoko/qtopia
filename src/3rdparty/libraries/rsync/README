librsync is the next generation of librsync, and provides flexible
checksum-based differencing.  The main application at the moment in
rproxy, but the library should eventually be generally useful.

This library was previously known as libhsync up to version 0.9.0.

To use anonymous CVS, see the file README.CVS in this directory.

>> Requirements

To build librsync:

  * A C compiler and appropriate headers and libraries

  * Make

  * popt -- command line parsing library

    Available from ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/code/popt

    A cut-down version of popt1.5 is included and will be used
    automatically if there is no popt library on your build host.

>> Note for RedHat 7.0

RedHat 7.0 (Guiness) ships with a buggy version of GCC 2.96 that
produces many warnings while compiling librsync.  These are harmless
-- the library seems to work anyhow.  You can avoid the warnings by
using the 'kgcc' version of the compiler:

  $ export CC=kgcc
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make all check

>> Library Versions

librsync uses the GNU libtool library versioning system, so the
filename does not correspond to the librsync release.  To show the
library release and version, use the librsyncinfo tool.

>> Platforms

librsync/rproxy is known to run on:

GNU Linux Debian 2.2 x86

SUNWspro: (use -v for more warnings)

mips-sgi-irix6.5: works, but you must use GNU Make rather than the
default SGI Make.  I used gcc.

>> API Documentation

librsync contains markup for automatic API documentation generation
using the Doxygen tool:
