This library has trolltech made modifications.  The files affected are
includes/sdp_lib.h
src/sdp.c

The modification introduces a new function
int sdp_extract_uuid_from_string(uint128_t *dst, const char *str);

This is used for converting 128 bit UUIDs to a 128 bit integer useable for creating uuid_t 
objects.

The autoconf-based buildsystem was removed and replaced with a simple qmake project file.
