This package has been modified by Trolltech to add the following features:

- Fix a small bug in hciconfig (hciconfig.c)
  which prevents it from displaying the correct 
  category of Â Peripheral or Imaging or Uncategorized device class devices 
  (reports as invalid).

   This change has been accepted into CVS post 2.25 build

- Small display issue / bug fix in sdptool.c regarding classification of 128bit UUIDs.  
- Capability for sdptool to perform searches by 16/32/128 bit uuids

- Add capability for hcitool to list paired devices, and remove currently bonded devices
  This functionality was ported from the bluez DBUS api, and is not scheduled to be
  accepted into bluez main tree.  Backported common/textfile.c and 
  common/textfile.h from cvs into 2.25.
