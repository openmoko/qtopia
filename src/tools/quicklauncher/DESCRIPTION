Run in the background by the Qt Extended Server to speed up launching of the next application
by performing startup tasks common to all Qt Extended applications.
The quicklauncher causes runtime linking to occur and constructs a QtopiaApplication
object so that when an application is launched it can be visible to the user sooner.
