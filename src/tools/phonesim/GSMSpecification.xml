    <profile>Select TE character set (Assign)</profile>
    <description>Set command informs TA which character set [chset] is used by the TE. TA is then able to convert character strings correctly between TE and MT character sets.
When TA‑TE interface is set to 8‑bit operation and used TE alphabet is 7‑bit, the highest bit shall be set to zero.
NOTE 1:	It is manufacturer specific how the internal alphabet of MT is converted to/from the TE alphabet.
Read command shows current setting and test command displays conversion schemes implemented in the TA.
Defined values
[chset] (conversion schemes not listed here can be defined by manufacturers):
'GSM'	GSM 7 bit default alphabet (3GPP TS 23.038 [25]); this setting causes easily software flow control (XON/XOFF) problems.
'HEX'	Character strings consist only of hexadecimal numbers from 00 to FF; e.g. '032FE6' equals three 8-bit characters with decimal values 3, 47 and 230; no conversions to the original MT character set shall be done.
NOTE 2:	If MT is using GSM 7 bit default alphabet, its characters shall be padded with 8th bit (zero) before converting them to hexadecimal numbers (i.e. no SMS‑style packing of 7‑bit alphabet).
'IRA'	International reference alphabet (ITU‑T T.50 [13]).
'PCCPxxx'	PC character set Code Page xxx
'PCDN'	PC Danish/Norwegian character set
'UCS2'	16-bit universal multiple-octet coded character set (ISO/IEC10646 [32]); UCS2 character strings are converted to hexadecimal numbers from 0000 to FFFF; e.g. '004100620063' equals three 16-bit characters with decimal values 65, 98 and 99.
'UTF-8'	Octet (8-bit) lossless encoding of UCS characters (RFC 3629 [69]); UTF-8 encodes each UCS character as a variable number of octets, where the number of octets depends on the integer value assigned to the UCS character. The input format shall be a stream of octets. It shall not be converted to hexadecimal numbers as in 'HEX' or 'UCS2'. This character set requires an 8-bit TA – TE interface.
'8859-n'	ISO 8859 Latin n (1‑6) character set
'8859-C'	ISO 8859 Latin/Cyrillic character set
'8859-A'	ISO 8859 Latin/Arabic character set
'8859-G'	ISO 8859 Latin/Greek character set

    <description>Enabled command returns intermediate result code +CHSR: [type] from the TA to the TE when an HSCSD call is being set up. The result code represents the current (negotiated or renegotiated) HSCSD parameters. If enabled, the intermediate result code is transmitted at the point of the call setup negotiation where the TA has determined what type of an HSCSD connection will be used. Result code transmission is done after possible service (+CR), error control (+ER), and/or compression (+DR) reporting but before possible TE-TA rate (+ILRR) reporting and before the intermediate result code CONNECT is transmitted. The format of the intermediate result code is:
+CHSR: [rx],[tx],[aiur],[coding]
For the value definitions, refer to +CHSN and +CHSC commands. For instance, for a non-transparent HSCSD call, result code '+CHSR: 2,2,4,8' means that the call has two timeslots in both up- and downlink, the air interface user rate is 28800 bps, and the used channel coding TCH/F14.4.

    <profile>PLMN selection (Assign)</profile>
    <description>Set command forces an attempt to select and register the GSM/UMTS network operator. [mode] is used to select whether the selection is done automatically by the MT or is forced by this command to operator [oper] (it shall be given in format [format]) to a certain access technology, indicated in [AcT]. If the selected operator is not available, no other operator shall be selected (except [mode]=4). If the selected access technology is not available, then the same operator shall be selected in other access technology. The selected operator name format shall apply to further read commands (+COPS?) also. [mode]=2 forces an attempt to deregister from the network. The selected mode affects to all further network registration (e.g. after [mode]=2, MT shall be unregistered until [mode]=0 or 1 is selected). Refer subclause 9.2 for possible [err] values. This command should be abortable when registration/deregistration attempt is made.
Read command returns the current mode, the currently selected operator and the current Access Technology. If no operator is selected, [format], [oper] and [ AcT]  are omitted.
Test command returns a set of five parameters, each representing an operator present in the network. A set consists of an integer indicating the availability of the operator [stat], long and short alphanumeric format of the name of the operator, numeric format representation of the operator and access technology. Any of the formats may be unavailable and should then be an empty field. The list of operators shall be in order: home network, networks referenced in SIM or active application in the UICC (GSM or USIM) in the following order: HPLMN selector, User controlled PLMN selector, Operator controlled PLMN selector and PLMN selector (in the SIM or GSM application), and other networks.
It is recommended (although optional) that after the operator list TA returns lists of supported [mode]s and [format]s. These lists shall be delimited from the operator list by two commas. 
NOTE:	The access technology selected parameters, [AcT], should only be used in terminals capable to register to more than one access technology. Selection of [AcT] does not limit the capability to cell reselections, even though access technology is selected, the phone may still re-select a cell in other access technology.

    <description>This command refers to supplementary service related network initiated notifications. The set command enables/disables the presentation of notification result codes from TA to TE.
When [n]=1 and a supplementary service notification is received after a mobile originated call setup, intermediate result code +CSSI: [code1][,[index]] is sent to TE before any other MO call setup result codes presented in the present document or in V.250 [14]. When several different [code1]s are received from the network, each of them shall have its own +CSSI result code.
When [m]=1 and a supplementary service notification is received during a mobile terminated call setup or during a call, or when a forward check supplementary service notification is received, unsolicited result code +CSSU: [code2][,[index][,[number],[type][,[subaddr],[satype]]]] is sent to TE. In case of MT call setup, result code is sent after every +CLIP result code (refer command 'Calling line identification presentation +CLIP') and when several different [code2]s are received from the network, each of them shall have its own +CSSU result code.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.

    <profile>Preferred PLMN list (Assign)</profile>
    <description>This command is used to edit the PLMN selector with Access Technology lists in the SIM card  or active application in the UICC(GSM or USIM). 
Execute command writes an entry in the SIM/USIM list of preferred PLMNs, previously selected by the command +CPLS. If no list has been previously selected, the User controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology, EFPLMNwAcT, is the one accessed by default. If [index] is given but [oper] is left out, entry is deleted. If [oper] is given but [index] is left out, [oper] is put in the next free location. If only [format] is given, the format of the [oper] in the read command is changed. The Access Technology selection parameters, [GSM_AcT], [GSM_Compact_AcT] and [UTRAN_AcT], are required when writing User controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology, EF EFPLMNwAcT, Operator controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology EFOPLMNwAcT and HPLMN selector with Access Technology EFHPLMNwAcT, see TS 31.102. Refer subclause 9.2 for possible [err] values.
NOTE1:	MT may also update the User controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology, EFPLMNwAcT, automatically when new networks are selected.
NOTE2:	The Operator controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology EFOPLMNwAcT, can only be written if the write access condition in the SIM/USIM has been previously verified.

    <description>Set command sends to the MT a password which is necessary before it can be operated (SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH‑SIM PIN, etc.). If the PIN is to be entered twice, the TA shall automatically repeat the PIN. If no PIN request is pending, no action is taken towards MT and an error message, +CME ERROR, is returned to TE. Refer subclause 9.2 for possible [err] values.
NOTE:	SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH-SIM PIN, PH-FSIM PIN, PH-FSIM PUK, SIM PIN2 and SIM PUK2 refer to the PIN of the selected application on the UICC. For example, in an UTRAN context, the selected application on a UICC should be a USIM and the SIM PIN then represents the PIN of the selected USIM. See TS 31.101 [65] for further details on application selection on the UICC.
If the PIN required is SIM PUK or SIM PUK2, the second pin is required. This second pin, [newpin], is used to replace the old pin in the SIM.
NOTE:	Commands which interact with MT that are accepted when MT is pending SIM PIN, SIM PUK, or PH‑SIM are: +CGMI, +CGMM, +CGMR, +CGSN, D112; (emergency call), +CPAS, +CFUN, +CPIN, +CDIS (read and test command only), and +CIND (read and test command only).

    <description>This command is used to enable/disable access to commands protected by security mechanism. This enables/disables access to command sets designated as 'secure' such as programming of MT. Refer subclause 9.2 for possible [err] values.
The TE asks for a [challenge] with [mode]=1 and one specific command set ([cmd_set]), the MT replies with the [challenge], which should be inserted into the identification algorithm in both entities (TE and MT). The algorithm output [token] is sent to the MT with [mode]=2 to enable the specified command set. [mode]=3 is used to disable the command set. 
The read command returns the status ([mode] 2 or 3) of each supported command set.
Defined values
[mode]:  
1	request challenge token to enable access to specified command set
2	enable access to specified command set ([token] required)
3	disable access to specified command set
[cmd_set], [cmd_set1], [cmd_set2]:
0 	MT/TA code re-programming command set.
other values below 128 are reserved by the present document
[token]: string type; a variable length bit string represented with IRA characters 0 - 9 and A - F, each character representing a nibble; e.g. bit string '0110 1100 1001 1010' is represented by the IRA string '6C9A'. The length of the required bit string varies depending on the value of [cmd_set].

    <profile>Generic UICC Logical Channel access (Assign)</profile>
    <description>Set command transmits to the MT the [command] it then shall send as it is to the UICC. In the same manner the UICC [response] shall be sent back by the MT to the TA as it is. Refer subclause 9.2 for [err] values.
This command allows a direct control of the UICC by a distant application on the TE. The TE shall then take care of processing UICC information within the frame specified by GSM/UMTS.
Although Generic UICC Logical Channel Access command +CGLA allows TE to take control over the UICC‑MT interface, there are some functions of the UICC-MT interface that logically do not need to be accessed from outside the TA/MT. Moreover, for security reason the GSM network authentication should not be handled outside the TA/MT. Therefore it shall not be allowed to execute a Run GSM Algorithm command or an Authenticate command in GSM context from the TE using +CGLA at all time whether the +CGLA is locked or unlocked. This shall not forbid the TE to send Authenticate commands in other security contexts (e.g. EAP security context).
For example, the TA/MT shall forbid the transfer of the Authenticate command to a USIM application when parameters P2 = 0 (GSM security context). See TS 31.102 [59] for USIM authenticate command definition.
NOTE:	Compared to Restricted UICC Access command +CRLA, the definition of +CGLA allows TE to take more control over the UICC‑MT interface. The locking and unlocking of the interface may be done by a special [command] value or automatically by TA/MT (by interpreting [command] parameter). In case that TE application does not use the unlock command (or does not send a [command] causing automatic unlock) in a certain timeout value, MT may release the locking.
Defined values
[sessionid]: integer type; this is the identifier of the session to be used in order to send the APDU commands to the UICC. It is manadatory in order to send commands to the UICC when targeting applications on the smart card using a logical channel other than the default channel (channel '0').
[length] : integer type; length of the characters that are sent to TE in [command] or [response] (two times the actual length of the command or response)
[command] : command passed on by the MT to the UICC in the format as described in 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS)
[response] : response to the command passed on by the UICC to the MT in the format as described in 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS)

This command allows a direct control of the UICC by a distant application on the TE. The TE shall then take care of processing UICC information within the frame specified by GSM/UMTS.
Although Generic UICC Logical Channel Access command +CGLA allows TE to take control over the UICC‑MT interface, there are some functions of the UICC-MT interface that logically do not need to be accessed from outside the TA/MT. Moreover, for security reason the GSM network authentication should not be handled outside the TA/MT. Therefore it shall not be allowed to execute a Run GSM Algorithm command or an Authenticate command in GSM context from the TE using +CGLA at all time whether the +CGLA is locked or unlocked. This shall not forbid the TE to send Authenticate commands in other security contexts (e.g. EAP security context).
For example, the TA/MT shall forbid the transfer of the Authenticate command to a USIM application when parameters P2 = 0 (GSM security context). See TS 31.102 [59] for USIM authenticate command definition.
NOTE:	Compared to Restricted UICC Access command +CRLA, the definition of +CGLA allows TE to take more control over the UICC‑MT interface. The locking and unlocking of the interface may be done by a special [command] value or automatically by TA/MT (by interpreting [command] parameter). In case that TE application does not use the unlock command (or does not send a [command] causing automatic unlock) in a certain timeout value, MT may release the locking.
Defined values
[sessionid]: integer type; this is the identifier of the session to be used in order to send the APDU commands to the UICC. It is manadatory in order to send commands to the UICC when targeting applications on the smart card using a logical channel other than the default channel (channel '0').
[length] : integer type; length of the characters that are sent to TE in [command] or [response] (two times the actual length of the command or response)
[command] : command passed on by the MT to the UICC in the format as described in 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS)

    <description>By using this command instead of Generic UICC Access +CGLA TE application has easier but more limited access to the UICC database. Set command transmits to the MT the UICC [command] and its required parameters. MT handles internally all UICC‑MT interface locking and file selection routines. As response to the command, MT sends the actual UICC information parameters and response data. MT error result code +CME ERROR may be returned when the command cannot be passed to the UICC, but failure in the execution of the command in the UICC is reported in [sw1] and [sw2] parameters. Refer to subclause 9.2 for [err] values.
Coordination of command requests to UICC and the ones issued by GSM/UMTS application inside the MT is implementation dependent. However the TE should be aware of the precedence of the GSM/UMTS application commands to the TE commands.

It also provides control over the use of the V.250 basic commands 'S0', 'A and 'H' for handling network requests for PDP context activation. The setting does not affect the issuing of the unsolicited result code RING or +CRING.
The test command returns the values of [n] supported by the MT as a compound value.
When the +CGAUTO=0 command is received, the MT shall not perform a PS detach if it is attached. Subsequently, when the MT announces a network request for PDP context activation by issuing the unsolicited result code RING or +CRING, the TE may manually accept or reject the request by issuing the +CGANS command or may simply ignore the network request.
When the +CGAUTO=1 command is received, the MT shall attempt to perform a PS attach if it is not already attached. Failure will result in ERROR or, if enabled, +CME ERROR being returned to the TE. Subsequently, when the MT announces a network request for PDP context activation by issuing the unsolicited result code RING or +CRING to the TE, this is followed by the intermediate result code CONNECT. The MT then enters V.250 online data state and follows the same procedure as it would after having received a +CGANS=1 with no [L2P] or [cid] values specified.
Defined values
[n]:
0	turn off automatic response for Packet Domain only
1	turn on automatic response for Packet Domain only
2	modem compatibility mode, Packet Domain only
3	modem compatibility mode, Packet Domain and circuit switched calls (default)
For [n] = 0 Packet DomainS network requests are manually accepted or rejected by the +CGANS command.
For [n] = 1 Packet Domain network requests are automatically accepted according to the description above.
For [n] = 2, automatic acceptance of Packet Domain network requests is controlled by the 'S0' command. Manual control uses the 'A' and 'H' commands, respectively, to accept and reject Packet Domain requests. (+CGANS may also be used.) Incoming circuit switched calls can be neither manually nor automatically answered.
For [n] = 3, automatic acceptance of both Packet Domain network requests and incoming circuit switched calls is controlled by the 'S0' command. Manual control uses the 'A' and 'H' commands, respectively, to accept and reject Packet Domain requests. (+CGANS may also be used.) Circuit switched calls are handled as described elsewhere in this specification.

    <profile>Manual response to a network request for PDP context activation (Assign)</profile>
    <description>The execution command requests the MT to respond to a network request for Packet Domain PDP context activation which has been signalled to the TE by the RING or +CRING: unsolicited result code. The [response] parameter allows the TE to accept or reject the request. 
If [response] is 0, the request is rejected and the MT returns OK to the TE.
If [response] is 1, the following procedure is followed by the MT.
Commands following the +CGANS command in the AT command line shall not be processed by the MT.
If the [L2P] parameter value is unacceptable to the MT, the MT shall return an ERROR or +CME ERROR response. Otherwise, the MT issues the intermediate result code CONNECT and enters V.250 online data state.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in 3GPP TS 27.060[34] and in more detail in 3GPP TS 29.061[39] and the specifications for the relevant PDPs. PDP context activation procedures shall take place prior to or during the PDP startup. 
One or more [cid]s may be specified in order to provide the values needed for the context activation request.
During the PDP startup procedure the MT has the PDP type and the PDP address provided by the network in the Request PDP Context Activation message. The MT may also have some or all of the following information -
	The MT may have a priori knowledge, for example, it may implement only one PDP type.
	The command may have provided an [L2P] parameter value.
	The TE may provide one or both of PDP type and PDP address to the MT in the PDP startup.
If any of this information is in conflict, the command will fail.
If one or more [cid] is given then an attempt shall be made to identify an appropriate context definition by matching the PDP type and PDP address in the network request with the PDP type and PDP address in each of the specified context definitions (in the order in which their [cid]s appear in the command) as follows -
	The PDP type must match exactly.
	The PDP addresses are considered to match if they are identical or if the address in the context definition is unspecified.
The context shall be activated using the values for PDP type and PDP address provided by the network, together with the other information found in the PDP context definition. An APN may or may not re required, depending on the application.
If no [cid] is given or if there is no matching context definition, the MT will attempt to activate the context using the values for PDP type and PDP address provided by the network, together with any other relevant information known to the MT. The other context parameters will be set to their default values.
If the activation is successful, data transfer may proceed.
After data transfer is complete, and the layer 2 protocol termination procedure has completed successfully, the V.250 command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code OK
In the event of an erroneous termination or a failure to startup, the V.250 command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code NO CARRIER or, if enabled, +CME ERROR. Attach, activate and other errors may be reported. It is also an error to issue the +CGANS command when there is no outstanding network request.
NOTE:	This is not the same as if the MT issues a +CGDATA (or +CGACT) command after receiving a +CRING unsolicited result code. A +CGDATA (or +CGACT) does not command the MT to acknowledge the network request but rather to make a new request for context activation. The network request would be ignored.
The test command returns the values of [response] and [L2P] supported by the MT as compound values.
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
Defined values
[response]: is a numeric parameter which specifies how the request should be responded to.
0	reject the request
1	accept and request that the PDP context be activated
If [response] is omitted it is assumed to be 0. Other values are reserved and will result in the ERROR response.
[L2P]: a string parameter which indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used (see +CGDATA command).
[cid]: a numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
