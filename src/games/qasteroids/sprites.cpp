/*! \class KSprite
  \brief The KSprite class is the base class for all the
         animated elements that appear on the screen in the
         asteroids game.

  The KSprite class inherits QGraphicsPixmapItem. It uses
  a list of pixmaps to draw and animate the item. The list
  represents the animation. The list can contain a single
  pixmap for items that are not animated. For example, the
  powerups are not animated, but the rocks and the ship are
  animated.

  The state of a KSprite includes the index into the
  list of pixmaps of the current image being displayed.
  It also includes the x and y components of the item's
  velocity on the screen, which is used for computing its
  next position.
  \internal
*/

/*!
  \internal
  The constructor gives the sprite to the scene, sets the
  x and y velocity componets to 0.0, and sets the current
  image to be the first image in the sprite's image list.

  It also marks the new sprite as not dead. If a sprite
  ever gets marked dead, it must destroy itself when its
  advance() function is called during phase one of the
  scene animation. But note that this is not true for the
  ship and shield. These two sprites are created once
  and maintained forever. They are handled differently
  with respect to death.

/*! \class KPowerup
  \brief Class KPowerup is the base class of all the powerup classes.

  A powerup is a reward that is generated sometimes when a
  small rock is destroyed.  Whenever the player destroys a
  small rock, a random number is generated. If the random
  number is one of the magic, powerup-generating numbers,
  then the corresponding powerup is generated and displayed.
  It travels around the screen for a time, and if it ever
  collides with the ship, the ship picks up whatever value
  the powerup represents. If the powerup never collides
  with the ship, it eventually dies and is removed from the
  screen and deleted.
 */

/*! \fn KPowerup::KPowerup()

/*!
  Generate a random number in a suitable range. If the
  generated number matches a member of a set of magic
  numbers, create a new powerup of the kind that maps
  to the generated number, and return a pointer to the
  new powerup. Otherwise return 0.
