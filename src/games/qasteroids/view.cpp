  \class MyGraphicsView
  \internal

  \brief The MyGraphicsView class is a subclass of QGraphicsView,
         which was created for the sole purpose of allowing us to
         implement our own resizeEvent() function.

  We need to re-implement that function to get the widget's new
  geometry once it has been resized to fit the space available. We
  do this by calling the base class resizeEvent(), which processes
  the resize event generated when the widget was resized to fit
  the available space.

  After processing that event, we get the width() and height() of
  the resized widget from the base class and use them to construct
  a rectangle at (0,0), which we use to set the scene geometry of
  our QGraphicsScene.
