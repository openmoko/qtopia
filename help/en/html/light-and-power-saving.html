<p><b>Power Saving</b>

<p>When running from battery we recommend checking both <b>Dim light after</b> and <b>Light off after</b> check boxes. Use the spinboxes to set the number of seconds before dimming the backlight, switching the light off entirely, and suspending the palmtop.</p>
<p>To prevent the palmtop from powering down while connected to a network, check <b>Disable suspend while online</b>.</p>
