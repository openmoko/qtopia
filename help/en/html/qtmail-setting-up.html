<p><b>Setting Up Email</b>
<p> Before you can use email you must have a network connection (see <a href="qppp-dialup-network.html">Network</a> setup), and you must set up your account. Normally you only need to do these once.</p>
<p>Tap <b>Accounts</b>, then tap <b>New Account</b> to invoke the <a href="qtmail-create-new-account.html">Create New Account</a> dialog. You can create as many email accounts as you need.</p>
