<p><b>Size Matters</b>
<p> Qt/Embedded is modular and scalable. You can assemble the Qt features you really need and leave the rest out.</p>
<p>Qt/Embedded includes the GUI server, client libraries, and window manager.</p>
<p>By picking and choosing features, the memory demands of Qt/Embedded can be tuned to between 800Kb and 3Mb in ROM (Intel x86).</p>
<p>Applications written with Qt have a small memory footprint compared to applications written with other toolkits due to sharing of the rich feature-set in the library.</p>
