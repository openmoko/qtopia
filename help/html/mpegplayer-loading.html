<b>Loading Media Files To the Device</b>
<p>
If media files are located on either a CF or SD card, when ever the
card containing the files is inserted, the card is automatically scanned
and any media files are listed in the Media Player.
<p>
To store media files located on a PC to the device's internal storage,
drag'n'drop the files in to Qtopia Desktop's documents view and click
on sync. The files are transfered to the device and are automatically
available for selection in the Media Player.
<p>
To transfer media files by any other means requires finding where the
media files are located using the <b>File Manager</b>. When the files are
located, Tap and hold on each media file, then tap
the <b>Add to Documents</b> menu option. The files will now be available
for selection in the media player.
