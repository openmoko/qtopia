<qt title="Category Details">
<h3>Category Details</h3>
<p>Categories are useful when you have large numbers of similar items, since you can view just those items that belong to a particular category.</p>
<p>By default all items are shown, regardless of category.</p>
<p>All applications use the same <b>Edit Categories Dialog</b> to create categories and to associate categories with items.</p>
</qt>
