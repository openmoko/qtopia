<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Randomize</b> will play the displayed files in a random order.</li>
<li><b>Loop</b> will repeatedly loop through the current list of files. To repeat just a single file, create a playlist with just that file and play it from the playlist with looping enabled.</li>
<li><b>Fullscreen</b> will display movies fullscreen.</li>
<li><b>Scale</b> will fit the movie to the available space. If this is unselected, the movie is instead played 1:1 which can be faster for some files.</li>
