<h3>Predictive Keyboard</h3>
<!--#endif-->

<p>The predictive keyboard works like a full-size keyboard, but uses a
dictionary to resolve mis-keying.  As you tap, words appear above the
keyboard in the hints bar.
<br>When you tap on the middle word you will accept that word.
<b>When you tap on the other words, they will switch to the middle.
<br>When there are many potential words for your input, you may need
to press an alternative on one side several times to find your word.</p>

<h4>Press-and-Hold</h4><p>To enter text not in the dictionary,
<b>press and hold down</b> on the keyboard. A bubble will appear above your
finger, magnifying that part of the keyboard. Move your finger slightly to focus this bubble on the letter you want and release to add it to your word.
</p>
<p>Words entered by this mechanism are automatically added to the dictionary
for future use.
For more information on adding or removing words from the dictionary,
see <a href="words.html">Words</a>
</p>
<p>Words containing numbers or symbols can generally only be entered
one character at a time, by pressing and holding for each one.
<br>You can mix specific letters in with the normal predictive mode, but most punctuation or numbers are not in the dictionary, and adding these characters will disable the predictive functions until you finish that word.
</p>

<h4>Stroking the Keyboard</h4>
<p>
A <b>right-to-left</b> stroke on the keyboard will erase the word being entered, or the last
letter if using the press-and-hold technique.
<br>When there is no word being entered, a right-to-left stroke will delete the character before the cursor onscreen.
</p>
<p>An <b>upwards</b> or <b>downwards</b> stroke will change the board
to capital letters, numbers or symbols.
<br>Note that the hints bar will show the capitalization in the
dictionary, but the keyboard will remember which letters you entered
as capitals. The symbol and number boards only accept the press-and-hold style input.
