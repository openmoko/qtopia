<p><b>Files</b>
<p>A number of files already exist on your device.  Mostly these are 
the files that make your system and applications work.</p>
<p>Store your own files in the <a href="documents.html">Documents</a> folder to make locating and working 
with them easier. Once you have created a file using the <a href="textedit.html">Text Editor</a> or another application 
it can be viewed in a text format or using the application it was created with.</p>
