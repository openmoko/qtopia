<li>Tap <img src=":image/hwsettings/new_stroke"> </img> and draw character. The indicator will update to 2/2 (2nd of a total of 2).</li>
<li>You can now compare the new and old versions of the character by tapping the <img src=":icon/up">/<img src=":icon/down"> </img> arrows located next to the input area.</li>
<li>If you are happy with the changed version, then remove the old one. To discard the previous version, display it then tap <img src=":icon/trash"> </img> to remove it.</li>
<li>To discard the new version and re-instate the original character, tap <img src=":icon/systemowned">. This reverts the setting for that character.</li>
