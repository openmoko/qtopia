<p>The Bluetooth FTP client allows you to transfer files over the bluetooth link between your <!--#echo var="device-name" --> and other Bluetooth devices that support the Bluetooth FTP profile.</p>

<p>If you're not connected to a device, you can choose to connect to a device by using the <b>Browse</b> action.  This will bring up a list of nearby devices that you can connect to.  Selecting a device from this screen will attempt to connect to the remote device's Bluetooth FTP service.</p>

<p>Once you're connected, you can transfer a file from the remote device to your local device by
<!--#if expr="$KEYPAD"-->
highlighting the file and pressing the <img src=":icon/select"><b>Select</b> button.
<!--#else-->
tapping on the file.
<!--#endif-->
</p>

<p>You can create new directories and put new files onto the remote device by using the <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> menu actions.  Deleting files or directories can be accomplished by using the <b>Delete</b> menu option.  You can also choose to disconnect from the remote device by using the <b>Disconnect</b> menu option.</p>
