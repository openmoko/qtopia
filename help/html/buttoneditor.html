Each of the hardware buttons on your <i>Qtopia</i> device, such as <img width=24 height=24 src= Button/0.png >
can be configured to activate a selected application or perform a particular 
action offered by one of your applications. Each button has two functions that can be controlled - <b>Press</b> and <b>Hold</b>.</p>
For example, you could configure a button to activate the <b>Contacts</b> application when <b>Pressed</b> 
and perform the <b>Beam your Business Card</b> action when you press and <b>Hold</b> it.
