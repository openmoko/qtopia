The function of hardware buttons, such as <img width=24 height=24 src= Button/0.png >
can be configured using the Buttons settings. You can choose what happens when you
press the button and what happens when you press and hold the button. The choices of
actions include starting applications as well as other services offered by applications,
such as beaming your business card (normally offered by the Addressbook application).
