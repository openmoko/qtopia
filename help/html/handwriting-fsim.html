   <h2>Handwriting</h2>
<!--#endif -->
<p>Enter text by writing each letter with the stylus, anywhere on the screen.</p>
<p>The following are a few special strokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Next word:</b> diagonal bottom-left to top-right and back down under the line.</li>
<li><b>Space:</b> horizontal left-to-right line.</li>
<li><b>Backspace:</b> horizontal right-to-left line.</li>
<li><b>Uppercase:</b> vertical line bottom-to-top.</li>
<li><b>New line:</b> diagonal top-right to bottom-left.</li>
</ul>
<p>The strokes for most numbers and letters of the alphabet are fairly intuitive. Some of the extra characters such as switching to upper or lower case and those used for punctuation are best explained by the visual aide provided in <a href="hwsettings.html"><b>Handwriting Settings</b></a> available in the <a href="qpe-settings.html"><b>Settings</b></a> area.</p>
<p>To use a scroll bar or other widget instead of entering text, hold the stylus still
for a moment before moving it.  Taps with the stylus are not used for text
input unless within a short period of a recognized letter or stroke.
