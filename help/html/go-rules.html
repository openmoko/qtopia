<h3 align="center">Rules of Go</h3>
<p>On each turn, you can place one of your stones on one of the
intersections of the board, or you can <i>pass</i> your move, letting
your opponent place another stone. The game ends when both players
pass in sequence.</p>
<p>Capture your enemy's stones by completely surrounding them with your
own stones. Captured stones will be removed from the board, and are called
<i>prisoners</i>.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to place a stone in a position that is completely
surrendered by enemy stones. You are not allowed to make a move that will
recreate the immediately previous position. (The rule of <i>Ko</i>.)</p>
<p>At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has conquered
the largest territory. Your territory is the area completely surrounded
by your own stones.<p>
