<p>The power management settings are used to configure the power saving functions of your device according to the power source being used. The brighter the screen display, the more battery power it is using. To save power, set screen brightness to suit ambient light conditions and use the power management features to dim or blank the display when you are not actively using the device.</p>
<p>To change power saving settings, select a power source then configure the power saving timeouts for that power source.</p>
<p><b>Brightness:</b> the brightness of the screen light can be controlled using the slider.
<p>Always ensure that the screen light is adjusted to a level that allows you to read the screen without straining your eyes.</p>
<p>In all power saving modes, the screen light returns to the configured brightness when any key is pressed.</p>
<p><b>Dim light:</b> sets the screen to a lower brightness level after a set time.</p>
<p><b>Display off:</b> sets the screen light to go off after a set time.</p>
<p><b>Suspend:</b> sets the device to go to sleep after a set time.</p>
<p>To deactivate any of the power saving modes, keep decreasing the timeout value until it changes to <b>Off</b>.</p>
<p><b>Add to profile</b> - The current state can be added to the active profile so that this state can be applied when the profile is activated. To do this, select <b>Add to profile</b> from the <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> menu.</p>
