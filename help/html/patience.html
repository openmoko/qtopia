<b>Objective:</b> Sort the cards in their suits from Ace to King.</p>
<br>
<p>Select Patience or Freecell from the <b>Play</b> menu.</p>
<p>Tap and drag cards to the desired location.</p>
<p>Tap <img src= CloseButton.png alt= X > to exit the game.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Settings</b></p>
<p>Tap <b>Change Card Backs</b> repeatedly to change the card backs.</p>
<p>Tap <b>Snap To Position</b> to make cards snap into position.</p>
<p>Tap <b>Turn One/Three Cards</b> to toggle between turning one or three cards at a time.<p>
<br>
<p><b>The rules of Patience</b></p>
<p>The objective is to pile the cards from Ace to King of the same suit in each of the top-right four piles.</p>
<p>In the bottom piles, cards can be added to those when the value of the card is one less than the previous card and
is of a different colored suit. For example, if there is a 10 of spades as the last card in the pile, only a 9 of hearts
or a 9 of diamonds can be placed on top of it.</p>
<p>When a card from the bottom piles is moved to reveal a face down card, that card is turned over to become the new top card
for that pile.</p>
<p>Multiple face up cards from the bottom piles can be moved together as one. Tap on the first card from where down you would like
to move from that pile the cards together.</p>
<p>Cards in the top left stack can be tapped on to turn them over. The face up cards can then be used to add to the bottom
piles or directly placed on to the top-right piles if the above rules of correct suit and value are met.</p>
<p>The top left stack can be turned over three times by clicking on the empty stack to begin going through it again.</p>
<p>If after going through the stack three times and when all moves are exhausted, it is possible that you are stuck and can
not solve the game. If this happens you may wish to try again and start a new game to solve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The rules of Freecell</b></p>
<p>The objective is to pile the cards from Ace to King of the same suit in each of the top-right four piles.</p>
<p>In the bottom piles, cards can be added to those when the value of the card is one less than the previous card and
is of a different colored suit. For example, if there is a 10 of spades as the last card in the pile, only a 9 of hearts
or a 9 of diamonds can be placed on top of it.</p>
<p>To help move the cards around, a card can be moved up to one of the empty 'freecells' in the top left four piles.</p>
<p>When moving multiple cards around from the bottom piles, the number of cards that can be moved together is determined by the
number of empty freecells are available. For example if you have four empty freecells and you also have one of the bottom piles
cleared, you then have 5 empty slots to move cards in to. When you move a pile, you could move 5 of the cards in to the empty
slots, then move the top card to the pile you wish to move the cards to, and then pile the 5 cards from the previously empty slots
back on top of that card. You would have then moved 6 cards from the pile so this is what is what you are allowed to move together
as one. It is the number of empty cells plus one. If however you are moving the pile in to one of the empty slots in the bottom
piles, the maximum is the number of empty slots, as the slot you are moving to would not have been able to store a card and have the
top card moved to it.
<p>Cards in the freecells can be moved back down to empty the freecell so that more cards can be moved together.</p>
