<!--#endif -->
<p>One entry in your contacts list can be set as an electronic business card, which can then be located quickly and sent to another device.</p>
<p>Set up a business card by putting your details into <b>Contacts</b>; then view your contact record, press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and choose <b>Set as My Card</b>.</p>
<p>Your business card will appear on the contacts list with a <img src=":icon/addressbook/personaldetails">.</p>
<p>To view your business card, either select it from the contacts list or press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and choose <b>Show My Card</b>.</p>
<p>To unset your business card, view it, then press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and choose <b>Remove as My Card</b></p>
<p>Since only one business card can be set at any one time, when a new card is set the previous one is automatically dropped; however, it continues to exist as a contact.</p>
