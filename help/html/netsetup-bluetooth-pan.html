   <h3>Bluetooth Personal Area Network (PAN)</h3>
<!--#endif -->

<p>The PAN profile allows to connect several Bluetooth devices together to form some kind
of ad-hoc network. To establish connections one device waits for other Bluetooth devices to connect 
to it. Once more than one device has connected the devices are joined together to form 
one big network whereby every device can communicate to all other devices.</p>

<p>PAN supports several network configurations at the same time. This allows quicker change of 
PAN networks without the need to reconfigure.</p>

<p>The Bluetooth PAN dialog has three sub-menus to setup a Bluetooth dial-up connection:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="netsetup-bluetooth-panacc.html">Account</a></li>
<li><a href="netsetup-bluetooth-panadv.html">Advanced</a></li>
<li><a href="netsetup-bluetooth-panip.html">IP Settings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Select a menu option to open the corresponding edit dialog, or press <img src=":icon/i18n/back"><b>Back</b> to save and exit the service details.</p>
