<p>Here you can discover all Bluetooth compatible devices in the near vicinity.
Before you can communicate with another Bluetooth device, you will first need to discover it.
If you plan to communicate with the remote device, you may also need to pair with the remote
device.</p>
<p>When you first enter this screen, it will display a list of all your "Favorite" devices. These are the devices that have been paired with your device, and other devices that you have marked as Favorite devices. (To add or remove a device from your Favorites, select a device in the list and press the "Add to favorites" or "Remove from favorites" option.)</p>
<p>To perform a device search and find all devices in the vicinity, press the "Find more devices..." entry in the list of devices. The display will then show the devices that have been found in the vicinity, and indicate whether each device is paired with your device. The pairing is indicated by the <img src=":image/bluetooth/paired"> </img> icon. If a device is paired to your device, the checkbox will be ticked.</p>
