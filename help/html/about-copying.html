<p>The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold.</p>
<p>Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified in the license certificate ("License Certificate") accompanying the Licensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered part of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict between the language of this Agreement and the License Certificate, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.</p>
<p>By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee should not install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software. In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise using any updates or other components of the Licensed Software that Licensee may receive separately as part of the Licensed Software ("Updates"), Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional license terms that accompany such Updates. If Licensee does not agree to the additional license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee should not install, copy, or otherwise use such Updates.</p>
<p>Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed Software in the manner provided below.</p>
<p>2. End-User License</p>
<p>Trolltech grants to Licensee a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to make and use copies of the Licensed Software for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing Licensee's software product(s) ("Products"). Licensee has the right to designate one, and only one, individual within Licensee's organization ("Designated User") who shall have the sole right to use the Licensed Software in the manner provided in this Agreement. Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited number of computers provided that the Designated User is the only individual using the Licensed Software. Licensee may at any time, but not more frequently than once every six (6) months, designate another individual to replace the current Designated User by notifying Trolltech, so long as there is no more than one Designated User at any given time.</p>

<p>The Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of, the Licensed Software or any part thereof, solely or as a part of a Product, its source code, in binary/compiled, or in any other form ("Redistributables"), except as provided by a separate distribution agreement with Trolltech.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above limitation, the Licensee may distribute the Product in binary/compiled form, dynamically linked against the Licensed Software, provided the only parts of the Licensed Software included in the Product are derived from the header files of the Licensed Software, and that no other parts of the Licensed Software are distributed in any form.</p>
<p>4. Generally Applicable Provisions</p>
