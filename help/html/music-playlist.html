<p>Use categories to create a playlist for your phone.</p>
<p>First <a href="qpe-categories-new.html">create a new category</a> with the name of the playlist.</p>
<p>Then edit the properties of each music file and assign them to the new category.</p>
<p>Now you can select <b>View Category...</b> and display a list of all those tracks in your 'playlist'. </p>
<p>Select the first in the list to begin playing from the playlist. <b>Music</b> will automatically play the next in the list when the previous is finished.</p>
