<b>Creating Play Lists</b>
</p>
<p>
Songs and videos can be listed in any particular order. To add a single entry
into the playlist, select the song or video and tap <img align="middle" src="mediaplayer/add_to_playlist.png" width="14" height="14">.
</p>
<p>
To remove an entry from the playlist, select the <b>Playlist</b> tab, select the song or video to
remove, and tap <img align="middle" src="mediaplayer/remove_from_playlist.png" width="14" height="14">.
</p>
<p>
The play order can be modified by selecting a song or video in the <b>Playlist</b> tab and
using <img align="middle" src="up.png" width="14" height="14"> and
<img align="middle" src="down.png" width="14" height="14"> to move the entry up or down in order.
Also the stylus can be used to drag items up and down the order of the list.
</p>
<p>
Use <b>Clear</b> from the playlist menu to remove all entries from the playlist.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Add all Music</b>, <b>Add all Video</b> and <b>Add all</b> from the playlist menu add to
the playlist the appropriate files visible from the Music and/or Video tabs. Category and location
combo boxes located at the bottom of those lists can be used to filter the Music and Video lists.
