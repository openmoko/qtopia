<p>This dialog allows you to select what types of events you wish to view in Calendar.  This can include 
appointments you create in Calendar, birthdays and anniversaries from your Contacts, due dates for your
Tasks, and any events from online calendaring tools that you have set up and synchronized.</p>
<p>A list with any available event sources will be shown, with check marks indicating which events will 
be shown.  Any accounts you have created (see <a href="datebook-accounts.html">Calendar Accounts</a>) will
also be displayed in this list.  Select an event source in the list to toggle the check mark.
