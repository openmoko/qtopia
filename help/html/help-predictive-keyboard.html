<h3>Predictive Keyboard</h3>
<!--#endif-->
<p>The predictive keyboard works like a full-size keyboard, but uses a dictionary to resolve miskeying on the small board.
As you tap, words appear above the keyboard.  If you tap on the middle, bold one you will accept that word.  If you tap on the other options, they will switch to the middle.  If there are many potential words for your input, you may need to press an alternative on one side several times to find your word.</p>
<p><h4>Press and Hold</h4>If you need to enter text that is not in the dictionary, you can also hold down on the keyboard.  A small bubble will appear above your finger, zooming in on that part of the keyboard.  Move your finger slightly to focus this bubble on the letter you want and release to add it to your word.  You can mix specific letters in with the normal predictive mode, but note that punctuation or numbers are not in the dictionary, and adding these characters will disable the predictive functions until you finish that word.  Therefore, words containing both alphanumeric characters and numbers or symbols can generally only be entered one character at a time, by holding for each one</p>
<p>For more information on adding or removing words from the dictionary, see <a href="words.html">Words</a>
<p><h4>Stroking the Keyboard</h4>To cancel entering a word, stroke right-to-left on the keyboard quickly.  This will erase the word being entered, or the last letter if using the press-and-hold technique described below.  If there is no word being entered, a right-to-left stroke will delete the character before the cursor onscreen.
<p>Capital letters are entered by stroking upwards on the keyboard to reveal the capital letters board, which functions just like the lowercase board.  Note that the hints bar will show the capitalisation in the dictionary, but the keyboard will remember which letters you entered as capitals.  Stroking up again shows the Symbol board.  Because the dictionary cannot be used to resolve ambiguities on the symbol board, it only accepts the press-and-hold style input.
The last board is the number board.  This can be reached by stroking up on the symbol board or down from the lowercase board, and contains numbers.  Numbers also do not use the dictionary prediction.</p>
