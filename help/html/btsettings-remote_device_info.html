<p>Here you can view more detailed information about a particular remote Bluetooth device.</p>

<p>Choose "Other details" from the context menu to view more details about the device, or "Supported services" to view the available Bluetooth services on the other device.</p>

<p>Choose "Set nickname..." from the menu to set a nickname for the device. This nickname will be used instead of the device name in the "Paired Devices" tab and when you are searching for nearby devices. The "Remove pairing" menu option will remove the pairing with the remote device.</p>

<p>If you are viewing the details of a headset or handsfree device, this screen also allows you to connect to and disconnect from the headset or handsfree unit. See the <a href="btsettings-headsets.html">Using headsets and handsfree units</a> for more information.</p>
