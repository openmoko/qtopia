<h3>Safe Mode</h3>
<p>Safe Mode is invoked when <i>Qtopia</i> crashes twice in quick succession. In Safe Mode, plug-ins are not loaded since it is possible that a plug-in caused the crash.</p>
<p>If you have recently installed a new plug-in (or a software package that includes a plug-in), then try disabling the plug-in via the <b>Plug-in Manager</b> and restarting <i>Qtopia</i>.</p>
