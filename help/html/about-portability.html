<p><b>Portability</b>
<p> Qt/Embedded features the same API as the excellent Qt/Windows, Qt/X11 and Qt/Mac.</p>
<p>You can write your Qt application in your favorite desktop environment and just recompile to move it to your embedded device.</p>
<p>And Qt/Embedded like all versions of Qt is supplied with source code to help you debug and tune your code.</p>
<p>Customer and community feedback allows us to continually improve the source code for better usability and performance.</p>
