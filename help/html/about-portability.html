<p><b>Portability</b>
<p>Qt/Embedded features the same API as the excellent Qt/Windows, Qt/X11 and Qt/Mac.</p>
<p>Qt applications can be written in your favorite desktop environment and moved to your embedded device simply by recompiling.</p>
<p>Like all versions of Qt, Qt/Embedded is supplied with source code to help you debug and tune your code.</p>
<p>Customer and community feedback allows us to continually improve the source code for better usability and performance.</p>
