<h3>Reading Email</h3>
<p>If you have an email account configured, you can read email messages.  Otherwise, you need to create an account: <a href="qtmail-create-account.html">Create New Account</a></p>
<p>To view email messages, select the <b>Email</b> folder from the folder list. A list of Email folders will be displayed.</p>
<p>The email Inbox contains a folder for each separate account you have set up.</p>
<h3>Retrieving Email Messages</h3>
<p>Usually, you need to ask the Messages application to retrieve any email messages that have been sent to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and select <b>Get all mail</b> from the menu.</li>
<li>Any new messages will be retrieved and placed into your <b>Inbox</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an email message has not been automatically downloaded because it is too large, it will be shown with "Awaiting download" instead of the message body. To download the body, press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and select <b>Get this mail</b> from the menu.</p>
