For <a href="categories-1.html">Categories</a>, pick from the list or tap the <b>...</b> button to invoke the <a href="category-editing.html">Edit Categories Dialog</a>.</p>
<p>You can also set <a href="datebook-event-times.html">New Event Times</a>, and an <a href="datebook-event-alarm.html">Event Alarm</a>, and you can make it a <a href="datebook-event-repeat.html">Repeating Event</a>.</p>
