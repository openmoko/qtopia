<h3 align="center">Safe Mode</h3>
Safe Mode is invoked when Qtopia crashes twice in quick succession.  In
Safe Mode, plugins are not loaded since it is possible that a plugin caused
the crash.
<p>If you have recently installed a new plugin (or a software package that
includes a plugin), then try disabling the plugin via the Plugin Manager
and restarting.
