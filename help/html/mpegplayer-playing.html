<b>Playing Media Files</b>
</p>
<p>
When already running the Media Player, tap a file in any of the tabs. This selects the file.
The hardware navigation keys can also be used for this. Tap the

button in the toolbar or use the hardware select button to begin playing the selected file.
</p>
<p>
The file will begin playing in the appropriate player screen which will be shown.
When the file finishes playing, the player will continue with any files listed in the tab from
where the file was selected. This is a handy way to play as an example, all music files which match
a particular category selected from the category list at the bottom of the music tab without creating
a playlist or manually selecting each file. It is also possible to rearrange the order of the files
in the tabs by pressing on the item and moving it up or down the list with the stylus.
</p>
<p>
To play a mixture of media files in succession you can also create a
<a href="mpegplayer-playlist.html">Play List</a> to
select the individual files which will be played after each other and rearrange the order
the same as with the other tabs.
</p>
<p>
If you are not already running the Media Player, a single media file can be played by using the
documents tab. Return to the main launcher view (pressing the hardware home button).
Then continue to press the home button until the documents tab is the current tab, or by tapping
on the documents tab in the top right hand corner. Find the media file you wish to play
in the list of documents and tap on the icon. The Media Player will be launched and will
begin playing the file.
