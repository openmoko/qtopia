<h3>Plug-in Manager Help</h3>
<p>The <b>Plug-in Manager</b> controls which plug-ins can be loaded by the
Qtopia system and its applications.</p>
<p>It is not usually necessary to disable plug-ins, however it is desirable
in some situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling <b>Taskbar Applets</b> can leave more free space on the
<b>Taskbar</b> to show running applications.</li>
<li>If an application or Qtopia itself crashes after installing new software that
includes plug-ins, the Plug-in Manager can be used to disable the faulty
plug-in.  This is particularly useful if Qtopia crashes and restarts in
<b>Safe mode</b>.</li>
</ul>
