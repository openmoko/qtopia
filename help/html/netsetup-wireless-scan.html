<p>Qtopia can actively scan for surrounding wireless networks. Every network that is selected 
will automatically added to the list of configured networks. </p>

<p>The priority determines the priority of configured/known WLANs. When attempting to connect 
(by means of manual or automatic (re)connect) to a WLAN the device connects to the WLAN with 
the highest priority first. The list uses a descending order (first WLAN has highest priority).</p>

<p>The order can be changed by selecting the WLAN using <img src=":icon/select">, then use 
<img src=":icon/help/dpad"> &nbsp; to move the selected entry up/down and finally lock the selected entry in the 
desired spot in the list be pressing <img src=":icon/select"> again.</p>

<p>The form provides the following context menu options:
<ul>
<li><b>Rescan:</b> initiates a new scan</li>
<li><b>Add new networks:</b> shows the result of the last network scan</li>
<li><b>Connect:</b> connect to the selected network</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> deletes the selected network.</li>
