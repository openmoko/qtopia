<h3>Ring Profiles</h3>
<p>Ring profiles are used to make the phone sound and behave differently when it receives a call/message. Your <i>Qtopia</i> phone has several <a href="profileedit-existing.html">existing ring profiles</a>.</p>
<p><b>To activate a profile:</b> highlight it, then pick <b>Activate</b> from the menu.</p>
<p><b>To change a profile:</b> highlight it, then pick <b>Edit</b> from the menu.</p>
<p><b>To change the ring tone:</b> highlight it, then pick <b>Edit</b> from the menu, and go to <b>Tone</b>. Highlight and select <b>Tone</b> to view options.</p>
<p>Where a ring tone has been set for a particular contact it overrides the current ring profile.</p>
<p><b>Airplane safe mode:</b> turns off the radio transmitter. No calls can be made or received in <a href="qpe-safemode.html">safe mode</a>.</p>
