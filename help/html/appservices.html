If two applications provide the same service (such as beaming your business card),
you can use the Application Services settings to nominate the application that is to provide the service.
<p>
Application Services normally only displays those services offered by multiple applications. It is, however, 
possible to view other services by selecting the other options in the <b>Show services which have...</b> 
area.
