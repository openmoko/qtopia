<p>If two applications provide the same service (such as emailing your business card) then you can use the Application Services settings to specify which application should provide the service.</p>
<p>By default only services with multiple providers are shown. To show all available services select <b>Show All Services</b> from the <img src=":icon/options"> <b>Options menu</b>.</p>

<p>To change the application that is used to provide a service:</p>
<ul>
<!--#if expr="$TOUCH"-->
<li>Tap the service name that you want to change.</li>
<li>Tap the application that you want to set to handle the selected service.</li>
<!--#endif-->
<!--#if expr="$KEYPAD"-->
<li>Use <img src=":image/help/dpad"> to highlight the service name that you want to change.</li>
<li>Press <img src=":icon/select"> <b>Select</b> to select the service to modify.</li>
<li>Use <img src=":image/help/dpad"> to highlight the application.</li>
<li>Press <img src=":icon/select"> <b>Select</b> to select the application.</li>
<!--#endif-->
</ul>

<p>When the list of applications that provide the selected service is shown the <b>Details...</b> item in the <img src=":icon/options"> <b>Options menu</b> can be used to managed the all services and mime types provided by the highlighted application.
