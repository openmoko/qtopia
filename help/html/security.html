A basic level of security can be achieved by giving the <i>Qtopia</i> device a passcode number.</p>
<p>Tap <b>Set code</b> to set the number. You must enter the number, then tap <b>OK</b>. Confirm the new passcode by entering it again followed by <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>Tap <b>Clear code</b> to purge the passcode. The <i>Qtopia</i> will no longer require a passcode.</p>
<p>Check the <b>Require code at power-on</b> checkbox to activate it. Once set, you must enter the code number whenever the <i>Qtopia</i> is switched on or wakes up.</p>
<p>Machines which are allowed to sync to <i>Qtopia</i> can be restricted. Select or modify the subnet in the <b>Accept sync from network</b> list. You can either specify the IP address of a single machine, or specify a network by an IP address with a slash (/) and the number of bits (eg. 10.0.0.0/8 means all addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255).</p>
