   <h2>Calendar Accounts</h2>
<!--#endif -->
<p>This dialog allows you to add, edit, and remove accounts for online calendaring tools.  It also
lets you synchronize your Calendar information with the online tools.
<p>A list of configured online accounts is displayed.
<ul>
<li><b>Adding an account:</b> you can add the details of an existing online calendar account by choosing the 
<b>Add Account</b> menu action.  This will present a list of supported online calendaring account types.
Currently, only Google Calendar<sup>TM</sup> accounts are supported.  View <a href="datebook-google-account.html">Google Accounts</a> for
more information on entering your Google Calendar account information.</li>
<li><b>Editing an account:</b> select an account in the list and choose <b>Edit Account</b> from the menu to edit
the account information.</li>
<li><b>Removing an account:</b> select an account in the list and choose <b>Delete Account</b> from the menu.</li>
<li><b>Synchronizing an account:</b> to update your local Calendar events with events from an online account, select
an account in the list and choose <b>Sync Account</b> to synchronize events.  Note that depending on the account type,
synchronization might be one way (for example, you can read your online events, but you can't update them, or create
new events in the online service).  Synchronization does require an active network connection.  A progress bar
will appear while synchronizing, and the results of the synchronization process will be displayed afterwards.
<li><b>Synchronizing all accounts:</b> to synchronize all your online accounts, select <b>Sync All</b> from the
menu.
