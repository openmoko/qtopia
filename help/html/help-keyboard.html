<h3>Keyboard Help</h3>
<p>Pop-up the input area in keyboard mode.</p>
<p>The keyboard works just like a full-size keyboard, except that you use a stylus instead of fingers. As you tap, words appear above the keyboard that you can tap to insert, rather than having to finish typing the word.</p>
<p>The Shift and Ctrl keys are 'sticky'; if you tap Shift, it will remain down until you tap it again or tap a letter.</p>
