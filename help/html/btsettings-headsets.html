<p>To use a Bluetooth headset or handsfree unit with your <!--#echo var="device-name" -->, you will need to "pair" with it and then make a connection.</p>

<p>To pair with the headset or handsfree device, see <a href="btsettings-pairing.html">Pairing with other devices</a>. Once you have created the pairing, the device will appear in the list in the <b>Paired Devices</b> tab. Select the device in the list, and a screen will appear with additional information about the device.</p>

<p>This screen can be used to connect to headset and handsfree units. To connect, press the <b>Connect headset</b> or <b>Connect handsfree unit</b> button.</p>

<p>Once you have paired with your headset or handsfree device and connected to it, it will "remember" your <!--#echo var="device-name" --> for future connections; you do not need to return to Bluetooth Settings to connect to the device. However, situations may arise where you will need to re-pair with a device if it is unable to find and connect to your <!--#echo var="device-name" -->. In this case, go to the <b>Paired Devices</b> tab, select the device from the list, and remove the pairing by pressing <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and selecting <b>Remove pairing</b>. Then, repeat the pairing and connection process described above.</p>
