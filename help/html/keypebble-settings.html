<p><b>Connection</b>
<p>Use the <b>Screen updates</b> spinner to update the screen faster or
slower.</p>
<p>Check <b>Request 8-bit session</b> to ask the server to only use 256
colors.
<p>Checking <b>Raise on bell</b> will bring the VNC viewer on top of any other
application when the VNC server issues a <b>bell</b>.  This is useful for
leaving the VNC viewer in the background and doing other tasks in the
foreground.

<p><b>Data Encoding</b></p>
<p><b>Encoding</b> refers to how a rectangle of pixel data will be sent
from the server to the client.  More efficient connections are possible
by using different encodings.  Note that the server must support an encoding
in order to use it.
<p><b>Copy rectangle encoding</b> works best with a framebuffer (as used
in <i>Qtopia</i>).
<p><b>RRE encoding</b> uses run-length encoding to compress pixel data.
<p><b>CoRRE encoding</b> is similar to RRE encoding, but optimized for
small (255x255) rectangles.
<p><b>Hextile encoding</b> is similar to CoRRE encoding, but uses tiling
rather than raw coordinates.
