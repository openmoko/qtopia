<b>Media Controls</b>
</p>
<p>
For both videos and music files, there are the following controls: previous, rewind, stop, play, pause,
fast forward, next and return to playlist.
</p>
<p>
<b>Play / Pause</b><br>
When playing, the play button is used to pause, and when paused, pressing it again resumes playing
from when it was paused. The hardware select button on the device is also able to be used for this.
</p>
<p>
<b>Stop</b><br>
If stop is pressed, the position in the file is reset to the beginning and
pressing play will begin playing from the start.
</p>
<p>
<b>Rewind / Fast Forward</b><br>
The rewind and forward buttons are for seeking through a media file. It is also possible
to use the hardware left and right buttons for this. To use the hardware buttons, hold down the
button in the direction you wish to seek, then release the button when it has seeked to
the desired position and the player will continue playing from there. 
It is also possible to use the position slider at the bottom of the window to tap on it
to position the playback instantly to a given position. For instance if there is a good scene
at the end of a video file you wish to jump to, tap on the slider towards the right end of the
slider to be taken near to the end of the video.
</p>
<p>
<b>Previous / Next</b><br>
The previous and next buttons are for moving through the playlist. The hardware buttons
can also be used for this if you prefer using the left and right buttons with a brief tap.
</p>
<p>
<b>Close</b><br>
Tap <img src=CloseButton.png alt= X> to stop playing and return to the list of media files.
The hardware cancel button can also be used to return to the media file list view.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fullscreen</b><br>
For movies files only, tapping on the movie while it is playing will change the mode. If the
movie is playing in fullscreen mode, the player will be taken out of fullscreen mode.
Tapping on the movie again can be used to change the view mode back to fullscreen mode.
