<p><b>Profile</b> - edit general information of the profile such as name, volume, automatic answering, vibration option and automatic activation. The name of a system profile cannot be changed.</p>
<!--#if expr="$TELEPHONY"-->
<p><b>Tones</b> - edit sound or video tones and alert types for incoming calls and messages. Where a ring tone has been set for a particular contact it overrides the current profile. You cannot select tones if Volume is Off.</p>
Available <b>Alert</b> types are:
<ul>
<li><b>Off</b>: no audible alert.</li>
<li><b>Once</b>: plays the alert tone only once.</li>
<li><b>Continuous</b>: for an incoming call, the alert tone is played until answered or disconnected from the other party. For a message, the tone is played for an user determined duration.</li>
<li><b>Ascending</b>: increases the tone volume if possible at every repeat of the tone while ringing.</li>
</ul>
Set the <b>Duration</b> if Continuous or Ascending alert type is selected for the message tone.
<!--#endif-->
