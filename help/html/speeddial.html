<p><b>Speed Dial</b> offers a fast and easy way to dial frequently called contacts, launch favorite applications, and access popular features using a 1 or 2 digit number sequence.</p>
<p>It allows you to set shortcuts to the functions and numbers that you use the most.</p>
<p>To invoke a 1-digit speed dial, press and hold for a few seconds the key for that digit while on the home screen. To invoke a 2-digit speed dial, press (and release) the first key, then hold the second key.</p>
<p>Speed Dial actions can be set in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the actions shown in Speed Dial.</li>
<li>From the menu in the Applications, Games, and Settings lists.</li>
<li>From the menu when viewing a Contact (be sure to highlight the number you want to assign to Speed Dial).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other applications may add their own Speed Dial actions.</p>
