<p>Your <!--#echo var="device-name" --> has a number of Bluetooth services that allow other devices to commmunicate with your <!--#echo var="device-name" --> over Bluetooth to perform particular operations. To configure these services, go to the <b>Settings</b> tab on the main screen, press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and select <b>My services...</b> from the menu.</p>

<p>This will display a list of the available Bluetooth services on your <!--#echo var="device-name" -->. The checkbox next to each service indicates whether the service is running, and the padlock icon shows whether security options are enabled for that service.</p>

<p>To turn a service on or off, click the checkbox next to that service. If a service is turned off, it can no longer be accessed by other devices.</p>

<p>To enable or disable security options for a service, press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and select <b>Use secure connections</b> from the menu. If security options are enabled for a service, and another device tries to connect to that service, then that device must be paired with yours before it can connect to the service.</p>
