   <h2>Pairing with other devices</h2>

<!--#include file="device-name.html"-->

<p>If you need to use a Bluetooth device with your own <!--#echo var="device-name" -->, you will probably need to "pair" with the other device (as a security precaution) before you can use it. To do this, go to the <b>Paired Devices</b> tab on the main screen, press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and select <b>Pair with new device...</b> from the menu. This starts a search for nearby Bluetooth devices and displays a list of devices that have been found.</p>

<p>Choose the device that you want to pair with from the list. You will be prompted to enter a PIN code; once you have entered a PIN, and the same PIN code is then entered on the other device, the pairing process is complete. The device will now appear in the <b>Paired Devices</b> list.</p>

<p>To remove a pairing, select the device in the list of paired devices, press <img src=":icon/options"><b>Options</b> and select <b>Remove pairing</b>. Once the pairing has been removed, the device will no longer appear in the list.</p>
