<p><b>Adding Events</b>
<p><b>To add an event to your calendar:</b><br>
- Tap <b>Event</b>, then <img align="middle" src="new.png" width="14" height="14"> <b>New Event</b><br>
OR<br>
- Tap <img align="middle" src="new.png" width="14" height="14"> on the toolbar.<br>
- Enter the details for the <a href="datebook-event.html">New Event</a><br>
- Tap <img src= OKButton.png alt= OK > to save the event or <img src= CloseButton.png alt= X > to discard it</p>
<p>Events can also be created quickly by tapping the date and time for a new event. When you tap a date in the Week or Month view you are switched to the Day view automatically where you can select a starting time.</p>
<p>When using this technique the date and start time of the event are set automatically.</p>
<p>The end time can also be set by tapping and dragging the stylus from the start to end time of the event.</p>
