The file manager is used to view and modify the files and folders on your device. 
Files can be opened with the application that created them or as plain text. 
You can also move, rename and delete files and folders.</p>
<p><b>It is important to use caution when using the file manager as many of the 
files on your device are system and application files.  That is,
they are the files that make your device and it's applications work.</b></p>
<p>Store and organize your data files in the <b>Documents</b> folder.</p>
