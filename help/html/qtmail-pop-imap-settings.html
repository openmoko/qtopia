<h3>POP & IMAP Settings</h3>
<p><b>Delete mail:</b> if ticked, retrieved messages will be deleted from the server when they are deleted from the <b>Trash</b> folder.</p>
<p><b>Skip large e-mails:</b> if ticked, large e-mails will be left on the server. You can retrieve the large messages by choosing <b>Get this mail</b> from the <b>Retrieve mail</b> dialog.</p>
<h3>POP only setting</h3>
<p><b>Synchronize with server:</b> most users should have this option ticked. When ticked the email client remembers the list of mails on the POP server.</p>
<h3>IMAP only settings</h3>
<p><b>Base folder:</b> if your mail folder is not your root folder you can set the base folder here (e.g. <b>Inbox</b>).</p>
