<b>Options</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Randomize</b> will play the displayed files in a random order.
</p>
<p>
<b>Loop</b> will repeatedly loop through the current list of files. To
repeat just a single file, create a playlist with just that file and play
it from the playlist with looping enabled.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fullscreen</b> will display movies fullscreen.
</p>
<p>
<b>Scale</b> will fit the movie to the available space. If this is
unselected, the movie is instead played 1:1 which can be faster for
some files.
</p>
<p>
<b>Skin</b> allows you to select the look of the player. Choose
<b>Default</b> or <b>Techno</b> to give the <b>Media Player</b>
a different look when playing songs.
