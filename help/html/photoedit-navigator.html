<h3>Picture Navigator</h3>
<p>The navigator is only available when the image is too large to fit on the screen. It appears in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>The navigator consists of two rectangles. The larger dotted one represents the image. The smaller clear one represents the screen. Use
<!--#if expr="$TOUCH"-->
the stylus or
<!--#endif-->
<img src=":image/help/dpad"> </img> to move the screen around the image.</p>
<p>Some operations will hide the navigator and return it when completed.</p>
