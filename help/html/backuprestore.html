<p>To restore from a backup, select the location of the backup. If you have stored multiple unrelated backups on the one device, choose the series. You then have the choice to restore everything (useful if your device is seriously damaged) or just specific files (useful if you have accidentally broken a single component, but you wish to keep other work). If you choose to restore specific components, you will be presented with the available backup dates for various components and you may choose which to restore.</p>
