    \class NotesDemo
    \brief The NotesDemo application is a simple text editor demonstrating the use of a QDocumentSelector.

    It is comprised of a QDocumentSelector and a QTextEdit in a dialog with a stacked layout so only
    one widget is visible at a time.  The document selector is initially visible and selecting a document
    or creating a new document will display the document in the text editor.  Accepting or canceling the
    editor will return to the document selector, saving the document if it was accepted, and accepting or
    canceling the document selector will exit the application.

    \a flags.
