This is a very simple example of how to write a popup input method.
It provids a set of buttons to produce hex diget key events, along
with return and backspace.  It can be thought of as a very simple
virtual keyboard.

The input method is defined in popupim.h and popupim.cpp

The plugin code for a InputMethodInterface is in popupimpl.h and
popupimpl.cpp

The plugin code for a ExtInputMethodInterface is in popupextimpl.h and
popupextimpl.cpp

main.cpp is a stub that allows testing of the input method in isoloation
from the qpe server.

See inputmethods.html for a detailed explanation of creating a Popup
Input Method.
