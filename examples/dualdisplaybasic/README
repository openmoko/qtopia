This is an example of a simple status display for a dual screen phone. It
provides a small display, similar to a monochrome LCD display that displays
the state of the phone. It illustrates use of the phone status library.
There are two possibilities for displaying the display.

1. Using one Qtopia display

In this case, the status display will appear as a floating display in the
Qtopia display.  This would be the common case for a LCD display which
does not need the complete Qtopia graphics engine to drive it.  To view in
this mode, simply run the application.

2. Using a separate display

In this case, the status display appears in a separate framebuffer.  This
case would be desireable on a larger, full color secondary display.
To view in this mode create a separate framebuffer and
start the application in this framebuffer. For example:

qvfb -width 83 -height 46 -qwsdisplay :2
./dualdisplaybasic -qws -display :2
