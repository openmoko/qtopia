The pstnmodem example demonstrates how to write a modem vendor plugin
and multiplexer that access the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
using a regular Data/Fax/Voice modem.  The modem is assumed to be visible
to Qtopia as a regular serial port.

The multiplexer handles switching between command and data modes so that
Qtopia can support both voice and data traffic on the same modem, although
not at the same time.  The multiplexer also handles out of band DLE
escape sequences, converting them into in-band AT commands and unsolicited
responses.

The modem vendor plugin uses AT commands from ITU Recommendations V.250 and
V.253 to implement the call functionality.  The plugin also has some
limited support for non-V.250/V.253 Rockwell modem chipsets.

Currently this example cannot put calls on hold, or transfer the audio
between handset, speaker, etc.  Further AT commands would need to be added
to support those features.  Since Data/Fax/Voice modems vary widely in
their supported functionality, extensive customization would be required
to deploy this example for a realistic device.

To activate the pstnmodem example, type "make install" in the pstnmode
example directory, set the QTOPIA_PHONE_VENDOR environment variable to "pstn",
and set the QTOPIA_PHONE_DEVICE environment variable to the name of the
serial port and baud rate.  For example, if the modem is connected to
ttyUSB0, the environment variables would be set as follows:

    export QTOPIA_PHONE_VENDOR=pstn
    export QTOPIA_PHONE_DEVICE=/dev/ttyUSB0:115200

If you are using a Winmodem device on a computer's motherboard, it is
important that you have installed the correct Linux drivers to make the
modem visible as a serial port.  The exact procedure for doing this is
beyond the scope of this document.  Consult http://www.linmodems.org/
for more information on using Winmodem devices with Linux.

Where possible, we recommend using an old-fashioned external RS-232 serial
modem, accessed via an RS-232 to USB converter cable if you don't have a
spare RS-232 serial port on your computer.  While a USB modem may be tempting,
it may not appear as a USB serial device to Linux, and so special drivers
will still be required.  The older (and dumber) the modem, the better.

When using an RS-232 to USB converter cable, the device will normally
show up as ttyUSB0, but there is no guarantee of this.  Consult the output
of "dmesg" to determine which USB port the Linux kernel has associated with
the modem.  Also make sure that the serial port device has user read-write
permissions if you will not be running Qtopia as root.
