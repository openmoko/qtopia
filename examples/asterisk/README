This directory contains the example Asterisk VoIP integration.
It uses the open source iaxclient and speex libraries and then
integrates against Qtopia's telephony API.

iaxclient/      Open source iaxclient library.
speex/          Open source speex voice codec library.
iaxagent/       Implementation of the Telephony service for Asterisk.
iaxsettings/    User interface for configuring Asterisk.
desktop/        Desktop definition files used by the Asterisk example.
pics/           Pictures used by the Asterisk example.
services/       Service definition files used by the Asterisk example.

The contents of the iaxagent directory provide an example of
integrating a third-party VoIP implementation into Qtopia.
The example inherits from QTelephonyService in iaxtelephonyservice.cpp
and overrides the functionality that is specific to Asterisk.

Other third-party VoIP implementations will need to follow a similar
pattern during integration.
