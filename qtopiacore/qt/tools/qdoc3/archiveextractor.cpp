  \class ArchiveExtractor
  
  \brief The ArchiveExtractor class is a base class for classes that
  know how to unpack a certain kind of archive file.

  The archive extractor contains a list of the filename extensions
  of the files that the archive extractor knows how to unpack.

  It maintains a static list of all the instances of ArchiveExtractor
  that have been created. It also has a static function for searching
  that list to find the archive extracter for a file with a certain
  extension.
 */

/*!
  The constructor takes a list of filename extensions, which it
  copies and saves internally. This archive extractor is prepended
  to the static list.
 */

  The destructor deletes all the filename extensions.

/*!
  This function searches the static list of archive extractors
  to find the first one that can handle \a fileName. If it finds
  an acceptable extractor, it returns a pointer to it. Otherwise
  it returns null.
