  \brief The PolyUncompressor class is a class for uncompressing
  compressed files.

  This subclass of Uncompressor contains a parameterized
  command for doing the uncompression

  It has an uncompressFile() function you call to do the
  actual uncompression.
 */

  The constructor takes the list of filename \a extensions,
  which it passes to the base class, and the \a commandFormat,
  which it stores locally. The \a commandFormat is a command
  template string.

  From \a filePath, derive a file path for the uncompressed
  file and return it. If it can't figure out what the file
  path should be, it just concatenates ".out" to the
  \a filePath and returns that.
