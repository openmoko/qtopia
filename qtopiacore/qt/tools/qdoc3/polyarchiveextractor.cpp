  \brief The PolyArchiveExtractor class is a class for unpacking
  archive files.

  This subclass of ArchiveExtractor contains a parameterized
  command for doing the archive extraction.

  It has an extractArchive() function you call to do the
  actual archive extraction.
 */

  The constructor takes the list of filename \a extensions,
  which it passes to the base class, and the \a commandFormat,
  which it stores locally. The \a commandFormat is a command
  template string.
