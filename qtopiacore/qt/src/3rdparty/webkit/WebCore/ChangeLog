        Fix for <rdar://problem/4886844> and lay groundwork for <rdar://problem/4516170> (Back/Forward Cache on Windows)

        All back/forward list and page cache related items used to be in WebKit.
        When they were pushed into WebCore, some sloppy compromises were made to keep the Back/Forward cache working on Mac.
        Namely, a WebCore::HistoryItem had to know how to keep a WebDocumentView alive.  We accomplished this via some #ifdefs
        in CachedPage and having the Mac-only CachedPageMac.mm

        To get rid of that nastiness and pave the way for adding Back/Forward cache on other platforms, this patch adds the 
        concept of "CachedPagePlatformData" which can contain anything the platform API wants.  

        I also took the opportunity to do other cleanup and renaming client methods to better fit their new purposes.

        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:

        <rdar://5548217>: [NTS] Java 6 update 3 crashes Safari when loading a

        It is possible to load Mozilla's Java plugin instead of our own, which

        <rdar://5548217>: [NTS] Java 6 update 3 crashes Safari when loading a 
        java page

        We purposefully do not destroy our Java VM when its reference count
        reaches 0, but we were unloading our JavaPlugin.dll when its reference
        count reached 0, which lost the reference to the VM. This led to our
        process trying to create a new VM the next time a page using Java was
        loaded, and the JNI spec states that a single process is not allowed to
        create more than one VM. The fix is to avoid unloading the Java plugin
        via our PluginQuirkDontUnloadPlugin.
