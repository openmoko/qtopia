  \class QXmlQuery

  \brief The QXmlQuery class performs XQueries on XML data, or on non-XML data modeled to look like XML.

  \reentrant
  \since 4.4
  \ingroup xml-tools

  The QXmlQuery class compiles and executes queries written in the
  \l {http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/}{XQuery language}. QXmlQuery is
  typically used to query XML data, but it can also query non-XML
  data that has been modeled to look like XML.

  Using QXmlQuery to query XML data, as in the snippet below, is
  simple because it can use the built-in \l {QAbstractXmlNodeModel}
  {XML data model} as its delegate to the underlying query engine for
  traversing the data. The built-in data model is specified in \l
  {http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/} {XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0
  Data Model}.

  \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_xmlpatterns_api_qabstractxmlreceiver.cpp 0

  The example uses QXmlQuery to match the first paragraph of an XML
  document and then \l {QXmlSerializer} {output the result} to a
  device as XML.

  Using QXmlQuery to query \e {non-XML} data requires writing a
  subclass of QAbstractXmlNodeModel to use as a replacement for the
  built-in XML data model. The custom data model will be able to
  traverse the non-XML data as required by the QAbstractXmlNodeModel
  interface. An instance of this custom data model then becomes the
  delegate used by the query engine to traverse the non-XML data. For
  an example of how to use QXmlQuery to query non-XML data, see the
  documentation for QAbstractXmlNodeModel.

  \section1 Running Queries

  To run a query set up with QXmlQuery, call one of the evaluation
  functions.

  \list

  \o evaluateTo(QAbstractXmlReceiver *) is called with a pointer to an
  XML \l {QAbstractXmlReceiver} {receiver}, which receives the query
  results as a sequence of callbacks. The receiver callback class is
  like the callback class used for translating the output of a SAX
  parser. QXmlSerializer, for example, is a receiver callback class
  for translating the sequence of callbacks for output as unformatted
  XML text.

  \endlist

  \list

  \o evaluateTo(QXmlResultItems *) is called with a pointer to an
  iterator for an empty sequence of query \l {QXmlResultItems} {result
  items}.  The Java-like iterator allows the query results to be
  accessed sequentially.

  \endlist

  \list

  \o evaluateTo(QStringList *) is like evaluateTo(QXmlResultItems *),
  but the query must evaluate to a sequence of strings.

  \endlist

  \section1 Binding A Query To A Starting Node

  When a query is run on XML data, as in the snippet above, the
  \c{doc()} function returns the node in the built-in data model where
  the query evaluation will begin. But when a query is run on a custom
  node model containing non-XML data, one of the bindVariable()
  functions must be called to bind a variable name to a starting node
  in the custom model.  A $variable reference is used in the XQuery
  text to access the starting node in the custom model. It is not
  necessary to declare the variable name external in the query. See
  the example in the documentation for QAbstractXmlNodeModel.

  \section1 Reentrancy and Thread-Safety

  QXmlQuery is reentrant but not thread-safe. It is safe to use the
  QxmlQuery copy constructor to create a copy of a query and run the
  same query multiple times. Behind the scenes, QXmlQuery will reuse
  resources such as opened files and compiled queries to the extent
  possible. But it is not safe to use the same instance of QXmlQuery
  in multiple threads.

  \section1 Error Handling

  Errors can occur during query evaluation. Examples include type
  errors and file loading errors. When an error occurs:

  \list

  \o The error message is sent to the messageHandler().

  \o QXmlResultItems::hasError() will return \c{true}, or
  evaluateTo() will return \c{false};

  \o The results of the evaluation are undefined.

  \endlist

  \section1 Resource Management

  When a query runs, it parses documents, allocating internal data
  structures to hold them, and it may load other resources over the
  network. It reuses these allocated resources when possible, to
  avoid having to reload and reparse them.

  When setQuery() is called, the query text is compiled into an
  internal data structure and optimized. The optimized form can
  then be reused for multiple evaluations of the query. Â Since the
  compile-and-optimize process can be expensive, repeating it for
  the same query should be avoided by using a separate instance of
  QXmlQuery for each query text.

  Once a document has been parsed, its internal representation is
  maintained in the QXmlQuery instance and shared among multiple
  QXmlQuery instances.

  An instance of QCoreApplication must exist before QXmlQuery can be
  used.

/*!
  Changes the \l {QAbstractMessageHandler}{message handler} for this
  QXmlQuery to \a aMessageHandler. The query sends all compile and
  runtime messages to this message handler. QXmlQuery does not take
  ownership of \a aMessageHandler.

  Normally, the default message handler is sufficient. It writes
  compile and runtime messages to \e stderr. The default message
  handler includes color codes if \e stderr can render colors.

  Note that changing the message handler after the query has been
  compiled has no effect, i.e. the query uses the same message handler
  at runtime that it uses at compile time.

  When QXmlQuery calls QAbstractMessageHandler::message(),
  the arguments are as follows:

  \table
  \header
    \o message() argument
    \o Semantics
  \row
    \o QtMsgType type
    \o Only QtWarningMsg and QtFatalMsg are used. The former
       identifies a compile or runtime warning, while the
       latter identifies a dynamic or static error.
  \row
    \o const QString & description
    \o An XHTML document which is the actual message. It is translated
       into the current language.
  \row
    \o const QUrl &identifier
    \o Identifies the error with a URI, where the fragment is
       the error code, and the rest of the URI is the error namespace.
  \row
    \o const QSourceLocation & sourceLocation
    \o Identifies where the error occurred.

  QtXmlPatterns calls the URI resolver for all URIs it encounters,

  When QtXmlPatterns calls QAbstractUriResolver::resolve() the
  absolute URI is the URI mandated by the XQuery language, and the
  relative URI is the URI specified by the user.
