  \class QXmlResultItems
  \brief The QXmlResultItems class iterates through the results of evaluating an XQuery in QXmlQuery.
  \reentrant
  \since 4.4
  \ingroup xml-tools

  QXmlResultItems presents the evaluation of an associated query as a
  sequence of \l{QXmlItem}{QXmlItems}. The sequence is traversed by
  repeatedly calling next(), which actually produces the sequence by
  lazy evaluation of the query.

  \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_xmlpatterns_api_qxmlresultitems.cpp 0

  An effect of letting next() produce the sequence by lazy evaluation
  is that a query error can occur on any call to next(). If an error
  occurs, both next() and current() will return the null QXmlItem, and
  hasError() will return true.

  QXmlResultItems can be thought of as an "iterator" that traverses
  the sequence of query results once, in the forward direction. Each
  call to next() advances the iterator to the next QXmlItem in the
  sequence and returns it, and current() always returns the QXmlItem
  that next() returned the last time it was called.
