     * for looking up the source location where that mapping is provided.
     *
     * However, this SourceLocationReflection is not itself the mark. The real

     * allows a SourceLocationReflection sub-class to delegate, or be an alias,
     * for another source location mark.
     *
     * If sourceLocation() returns a non-null object, it will be used instead
     * of looking up via actualReflection().
