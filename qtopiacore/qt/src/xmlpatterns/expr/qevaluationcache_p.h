     * @short Evaluates to the same result as its operand, but ensures the
     * operand is evaluated once even if this Expression is evaluated several
     * times during a query run.
     *
     * EvaluationCache does this in a pipelined way, by delivering items from
     * its cache, which is stored in the DynamicContext. If the cache has less
     * items than what the caller requests, EvaluationCache continues to
     * deliver but this time from the source, which it also populates into the
     * cache.
     *
     * EvaluationCache is used as an optimization in order to avoid running expensive code
     * paths multiple times, but also is sometimes a necessity: for instance,
     * when objects must be unique, such as potentially in the case of node identity.
     *
     * EvaluationCache is in particular used for variables, whose sole purpose
     * is to store it once(at least conceptually) and then use it in multiple
     * places.
     *
     * In some cases an EvaluationCache isn't necessary. For instance, when a
     * variable is only referenced once. In those cases EvaluationCache removes
     * itself as an optimization; implemented in EvaluationCache::compress().
