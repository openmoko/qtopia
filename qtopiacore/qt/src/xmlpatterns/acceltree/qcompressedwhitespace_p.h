     * @short A compression facility for whitespace nodes.
     *
     * CompressedWhitespace compresses and decompresses strings that consists of
     * whitespace only, and do so with a scheme that is designed to do this
     * specialized task in an efficient way. The approach is simple: each
     * sequence of equal whitespace in the input gets coded into one byte,
     * where the first two bits signals the type, CharIdentifier, and the
     * remininding six bits is the count.
     *
     * For instance, this scheme manages to compress a sequence of spaces
     * followed by a new line into 16 bits(one QChar), and QString stores
     * strings of one QChar quite efficiently, by avoiding a heap allocation.
     *
     * There is no way to tell whether a QString is compressed or not.
     *
     * The compression scheme originates from Saxon, by Michael Kay.
