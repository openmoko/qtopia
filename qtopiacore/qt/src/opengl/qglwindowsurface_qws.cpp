    \brief The QWSGLWindowSurface class provides the drawing area for top-level
    windows in Qtopia Core on EGL/OpenGLES. It also provides the drawing area for
    QGLWidgets whether they are top-level windows or child widget of another QWidget.

    Note that this class is only available in Qtopia Core and only available if
    Qt is configured with OpenGL support.
