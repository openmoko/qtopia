    \class QSslCipher
    \brief The QSslCipher class represents an SSL cryptographic cipher.
    \since 4.3

    \reentrant
    \ingroup io
    \ingroup ssl
    \module network

    QSslCipher stores information about one cryptographic cipher. It
    is most commonly used with QSslSocket, either for configuring
    which ciphers the socket can use, or for displaying the socket's
    ciphers to the user.
