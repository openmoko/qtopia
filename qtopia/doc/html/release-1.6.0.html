</table><h1 align=center>Qtopia - 1.6.0 Release Notes</h1>


<p> 
<p> The Qtopia 1.6 release constituted a rounding out of the Qtopia
platform, with a number of improvements resulting from one year
of field experience with 1.5. Completeness and stability have been
the focus of development. Additional attention has been paid to
usability, maintainability, and flexibility.
<p> <h3> Completeness
</h3>
<a name="1"></a><p> The Qtopia device platform now includes many of the finishing
touches one would expect from the leading GUI on embedded Linux.
Added features are:
<p> <ul>
<li> 'Today' application showing interesting items for the day.
<li> Voice Recorder with <a href="gsm.html">GSM</a> audio compression.
<li> Simple daily alarm feature (set in the Clock application).
<li> User-definable association of applications to services
(for example, the user can choose which
web browser provided the WebAccess service).
<li> User-definable actions for device hardware buttons.
<li> Different light and power settings when on battery or mains power.
<li> User control over which plug-ins are loaded, and protection
from plug-ins that cause a crash.
</ul>
<p> Numerous other minor improvements have added to the general
polish of the application suite.
<p> The Qtopia development platform has also been tuned from our
experiences with developers. The following features have been
added to the Qtopia SDK:
<p> <ul>
<li> <em>Accessory</em> - the ability to install items in the Q-Menu
for frequently-accessed functionality that does not
otherwise require space in the taskbar.
<li> <em>QPEDatePicker</em> - a widget for selecting dates.
<li> <em>DeviceButton</em> - an abstraction of device hardware buttons.
<li> <em>DocPropertiesWidget</em> and <em>DocPropertiesDialog</em> - a
widget for allowing the user to set document properties.
<li> <em>LocationCombo</em> - a widget for selecting a storage location.
<li> <em>QProcess</em> - the Qt class for running processes asynchronously.
<li> <em>QWizard</em> - the Qt class for simple wizard dialogs.
<li> <em>TimeZone</em> - encapsulation of the system zoneinfo database.
<li> <em>Service</em> - the ability to refer to and provide actions
without specifically identifying the application that
might provide the service.
<li> <em>DocLnk</em> - the location for the document can be easily set.
<li> <em>Calendar</em> - a number of useful date operations are added.
<li> <em>Config</em> - QByteArray values can be stored.
<li> <em>Global</em> - applications can inspect the Qtopia version,
architecture, device ID, and owner name.
<li> <em>Global</em> - Base64 encoding and decoding functions are provided.
<li> <em>QPEApplication</em> - functions for showing and executing dialogs
such that they are resized, positioned, or maximized as appropriate
for the device.
<li> <em>Resource</em> - function to load QIconSet values, and a superior
function for generating 'disabled' icons.
<li> <em>TimeString</em> - functions for simply generating locale- and user-specific
formatted dates and times.
</ul>
<p> A number of other minor functions have been added.
<p> <h3> Stability and Correctness
</h3>
<a name="1-1"></a><p> A broad range of bugs have been found, tracked, and corrected for
this release.
<p> Bug reports have been collected from users, developers, and
our internal test teams.
<p> A number of known bugs remain, but none that cause
difficulty for the end user. A full list of known bugs is available,
and access to our bug tracking system is available to OEM customers.
<p> Conformance to existing standards has been improved, especially
the OBEX, vCalendar and vCard protocols used in beaming.
<p> <h3> Usability
</h3>
<a name="1-2"></a><p> Consistency between applications has been improved to enhance
user familiarity.
A number of applications have been modified to
simplify the user experience.
<p> The software package management and backup/restore software
have been modified to use a <em>Wizard</em>
interface, greatly simplifying their operation.
<p> <h3> Maintainability
</h3>
<a name="1-3"></a><p> A major change in Qtopia 1.6 is to utilize the cross-platform
nature of Qt and the Qtopia applications to re-use the PDA-side
application code directly in Qtopia Desktop on all desktop
platforms. This ensures that the desktop and PDA remain perfectly
consistent, which assists user comprehension and halves the
number of possible bugs. As a bonus, the PDA-side code is now
more able to utilize larger displays such as the 640 x 480 and
larger displays now available on PDAs and tablet/webpad devices.
<p> <h3> Flexibility
</h3>
<a name="1-4"></a><p> Field experience has demonstrated vendor and user desire to customize
and personalize devices and to extend functionality in unplanned
directions. Qtopia 1.6 assists this by providing for:
<p> <ul>
<li> Pluggable styles
<li> Pluggable window decorations
<li> Pluggable characterset encodings
<li> Pluggable font engines
<li> Pluggable image format support
<li> Pluggable language input methods
<li> Pluggable beaming controls
<li> Pluggable 'Today' sections
<li> User-selection of application/service associations
</ul>
<p> This is in addition to the support already in 1.5:
<p> <ul>
<li> Pluggable media player format support
<li> Pluggable visual input methods
<li> Pluggable network services
<li> Pluggable color schemes
<li> Pluggable language support
</ul>
<p> Additionally, vendor-specific device configuration allows
for the simple control of:
<p> <ul>
<li> Device hardware buttons
<li> Device calibration needs
<li> Device power management support
<li> Device backlight controls
<li> Device audio support
<li> Device hardware LED support
</ul>
<p> <h3> Since the last beta
</h3>
<a name="1-5"></a><p> For those familiar with the last Qtopia beta release, the following
specific points of change should be considered:
<p> <ul>
<li><b>Device Architecture</b>
<p> The file <tt>src/libraries/custom-*.h</tt> for each
platform defines <tt>QPE_ARCHITECTURE</tt>, a string
of the form <tt>"&lt;em&gt;Vendor/Brand&lt;/em&gt;"</tt>. If you have a
custom version of this file for your device, you should
define this string. This string is communicated to
Qtopia Desktop to assist the user in acquiring packages
appropriate to their device.
<li><b>Today Auto-start</b>
<p> The Today application can be autostarted. To enable this,
define QPE_DEFAULT_TODAY_MODE to "Daily" (including the
quotes in the <tt>custom-*.h</tt> file for your platform. The user
can turn this off in the Edit Today View dialog. If the
<tt>custom.h</tt> does not define anything, then the default
will be to not autostart (but the user can still enable it if
they choose). The <tt>custom.h</tt> files shipped with Qtopia
all define the "Daily" mode.
</ul>
