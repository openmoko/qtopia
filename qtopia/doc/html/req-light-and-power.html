<p> <b>Power Management</b> is a settings application. It allows the user to
set up the device's display and change settings to regulate power use.
<p> <h2> Features
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> The features of the <b>Power Management</b> settings application
allow the user to configure the device to behave differently under
different usage conditions and to suit individual tastes. The configuration
extends only to the display screen.
<p> <h3> Automatic Behaviour When phone is Not in Use
</h3>
<a name="1-1"></a><p> The user is able to configure a number of settings to take
effect when the device is not in use.
<p> <h4> Set Display Lighting to Automatically Change
</h4>
<a name="1-1-1"></a><p> The user may enable features to dim or turn off the
display lighting when the device has not been used for a time.
If enabled each feature is further configurable by changing a
timer that controls the delay before activation. The timer is
specified in increments of 15 seconds from 10 seconds up to 3600
seconds (an hour) by using the up and down arrows or by typing in
an exact figure in seconds.
<p> The timers commence counting as soon as the user ceases interacting
with the device (by pressing keys or using the stylus). There is no
visible feedback that the timers are running. Any interaction
with the device restarts the timer. 
<p> Automatic display lighting features are:
<ul>
<li> <b>Dimming of the display lighting:</b> after a user specified amount of time.
<li> <b>Turning display lighting off:</b> after a user specified amount of time.
<li> It is possible for the user to enable / disable the above.
</ul>
<p> <h4> Set Display to Automatically Return to the Home Screen 
</h4>
<a name="1-1-2"></a><p> With this feature the device is configured to quit applications and
display the home screen when the device is not in use. The home
screen is the blank desktop display of the device that appears when
the device is powered on. The feature is controlled by a timer in
a similar fashion to the display lighting in the previous section.
<p> If an application such as <b>Notes</b> is left open, editing a note, the
user is not prompted to save the note: the note application
simply quits. For this reason care needs to be used with
this setting to avoid data loss if the device is to be used for
creating documents.
<p> The feature allows the user to:
<p> <ul>
<li> Set the amount of time to wait before returning to the home screen.
<li> Turn this feature off or on.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Display brightness
</h3>
<a name="1-2"></a><p> The user is able to control the display backlighting to suit the
brightness of their surroundings and their individual tastes.
Higher settings will use more power.
<p> The feature allows the user to:
<p> <ul>
<li> Adjust the brightness of the display.
</ul>
