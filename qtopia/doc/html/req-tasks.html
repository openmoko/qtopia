<p> The <b>Tasks</b> application allows the user to prioritize tasks,
manage due dates and, when appropriate, mark tasks as completed.
<p> <h2> Data
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> A task consists of the following data:
<p> <ul>
<li> A single line text description.
<li> A priority ranging from 1 as the highest priority to 5 as the lowest priority.
<li> Multi-lined text notes.
<li> A status consisting of:
<ul>
<li> Not started
<li> In Progress
<li> Completed
<li> Waiting
<li> Deferred
</ul>
<li> A percentage completed. Not applicable if a task status is Not Started or Completed.
<li> The date the task is due for completion. This is optional.
<li> The date the task was started. Not applicable if the task status is
Not Started.
<li> The date the task was completed. Only applicable if the task status is
Completed.
<li> One or more categories. If the task is not assigned any category it is
marked as <i>unfiled</i>.
</ul>
<p> <h2> Application Views
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> It is possible to view tasks in the following three ways:
<p> <ul>
<li> As a sorted list of tasks.
<li> A detailed view of a single task.
<li> A task opened for editing.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Sorted List
</h3>
<a name="2-1"></a><p> The primary display of the application shows a sorted list of tasks. In this
list a user is able to change the priority of a task, mark a task Completed
or view additional details of the task.
<p> The sorting order of the tasks is:
<ul>
<li> Completed: incomplete tasks are shown first.
<li> Priority: tasks with a priority closer to 1 are shown first.
<li> Description: tasks are shown in alphabetic order.
</ul>
<p> From the sorted list view the user is able to:
<ul>
<li> Create a new task through the Edit View of the task.
<li> View the details for the task through the Detailed View of the task.
<li> Mark tasks as completed.
<li> Change the priority of a task
<li> Filter the list of tasks shown according to a specified category.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Detailed View
</h3>
<a name="2-2"></a><p> The detailed view of a task shows data for a single task.  This is shown as
rich text.  All the information for the task is formatted for optimum readability.
<p> From the sorted list view the user is able to:
<ul>
<li> Edit the current task through the Edit View of the task.
<li> Delete the current task.
<li> Beam the current task using IR.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Edit View
</h3>
<a name="2-3"></a><p> The edit view of a task allows the user to specify the data for a new task
or modify that of an old task.
<p> Non-applicable values are disabled. For example, the start date field is disabled if the the task status is marked as Not Started.
<p> When the editing has been completed the user is able to either accept or cancel the changes they have made.
<p> <h2> Features
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> <h3> Add Task
</h3>
<a name="3-1"></a><p> It is possible to add tasks. The application does not add a task without a description.
<p> <h3> Delete Task
</h3>
<a name="3-2"></a><p> It is possible to delete tasks. The application prompts the user to confirm the deletion of a task.
<p> <h3> Edit Task 
It is possible to modify tasks. This includes changing the status and adding notes.
</h3>
<a name="3-3"></a><p> <h3> Beaming
</h3>
<a name="3-4"></a><p> It is possible to beam a single task to or from another device using IR.
<p> <h3> Priorities
</h3>
<a name="3-5"></a><p> It is possible to prioritize tasks using the scale of 1 as the highest and 5 as the lowest.
<p> <h3> <a href="categories.html">Categories</a>
</h3>
<a name="3-6"></a><p> It is possible to categorize tasks.
<p> <h3> Filtering
</h3>
<a name="3-7"></a><p> It is possible to filter the view of tasks by category.
<p> <h3> Maximum Number of Tasks
</h3>
<a name="3-8"></a><p> The maximum number of tasks is determined by the available device memory. Once this limit is reached it is only possible to delete tasks; they cannot be edited nor can any new tasks be added.
<p> <h3> Storage
</h3>
<a name="3-9"></a><p> Each event requires approximately 100 bytes of storage plus UTF-8 string
storage for the description, plus approximately 16 bytes per category membership, plus approximately 50 bytes if a due date is specified.
<p> <h3> Memory
</h3>
<a name="3-10"></a><p> While running, each event requires approximately 300 bytes of storage,
plus UTF-16 string storage for the description, plus approximately 80 bytes per category membership.
<p> <h3> <a href="qdl.html">QDL</a> Support
</h3>
<a name="3-11"></a><p> It is possible to access tasks from other applications via the QDL service interface.
When activated the <b>Tasks</b> application runs and shows linked tasks.
<p> QDL links are embedded into the notes of a task.  When in the Detailed View,
clicking on a QDL link activates the link's application.
<p> <h2> Files
</h2>
<a name="4"></a><p> The <b>Tasks</b> application has two data files.
<p> <ul>
<li> <pre>$HOME&#92;Applications&#92;todolist&#92;todolist.xml</pre>- main list of task data.
<li> <pre>$HOME&#92;.todojournal</pre>- journal of changes to list of tasks since application started.
</ul>
<p> Both files are in an xml-like format. <pre>todolist.xml</pre>is the main list
of events and is the file sent to Qtopia Desktop on syncing. <pre>.todojournal</pre><p> is a list of adds, edits and deletes made to the list of events since the <b>Tasks</b> application was started.
<p> <h2> Configuration
</h2>
<a name="5"></a><p> The Phone Edition's <b>Task</b> application does not store any configuration-related data.
<p> <h2> Services
</h2>
<a name="6"></a><p> <ul>
<li> IR Receive text/x-vCalendar-Tasks
<li> Tasks - allows editing of tasks via PIM Library interface.
<li> <a href="qdl.html">QDL</a>
</ul>
