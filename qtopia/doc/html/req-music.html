<p> The Music application is used to manage and play various types of music
files. The available files are listed using the Qtopia document model.
The music is categorized and information about the files is displayed.
<p> <h2> Features
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> <h3> Supported Formats
</h3>
<a name="1-1"></a><p> Music supports a range of audio formats including:
<ul>
<li> MP2 & MP3
<li> WAV (PCM <a href="gsm.html">GSM</a>)
<li> AMR
</ul>
<p> <h3> Scanning for Music Documents
</h3>
<a name="1-2"></a><p> Scanning for music files incrementally searches the following locations:
<ul>
<li> Directories returned by <a href="qpeapplication.html#documentDir">QPEApplication::documentDir</a>()
<li> All mounted file systems returned by Storage::fileSystems() where the
file system is for a removable media device (for example SD cards, CF cards)
</ul>
As the scanning takes place, a percentage progress indicator displays the
estimated completion of the document scanning, since it may take some time for large music collections.
<p> It is possible to filter the list of files as it is being generated. This filtering is carried out by user specified category.
<p> Re-scanning takes place when the program is notified of document changes.
Events that cause an update of the listed files include:
<ul>
<li> Another application or process changing a property of an existing document.
<li> When a document is added or removed.
<li> When a removable storage card is inserted or removed and the corresponding
filesystem is mounted or unmounted. The application relists the files that
are now available due to the change in removable media.
</ul>
<p> <h2> Music Documents List
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> The following features are required:
<p> <ul>
<li> Sorting: it is possible to alphabetically sort the list of music files.
<li> Up/Down: it is possible for the user to reorder the list of files. It is expected that this will be possible using the directional keypad.
<li> Category: it is possible to select files and add them to a Category.
<li> Add to Category: it is possible for the user to create a new category and
for them to sort the music into different 'collections' using the
categories. This allows playlists to be created.
<li> The user is able to add files to a category as well as switch to a different category view.
<li> Properties: it is possible to display and edit the properties of an
individual music file. The following properties are available for editing:
<ul>
<li> Document name
<li> <a href="categories.html">Categories</a>
<li> ID3 tags (where applicable)
</ul>
<li> When available the media codec information including codec, bitrate etc is also displayed.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Playing Music Files
</h3>
<a name="2-1"></a><p> It is possible to select a music file from the list and play the file without
the music application already having been launched. When the file is played,
the appropriate decoder plugin will be found and initialized. The
music application then displays the user interface to control the playback of the file.
It is possible to install different decoder plugins on the device and for the player to detect them.
<p> Music files are also played when selected
from the documents list of the Qtopia Launcher. When launched from the documents
list the player UI is displayed immediately, and the scanning for documents is avoided.
<p> <h3> Playback Options
</h3>
<a name="2-2"></a><p> When a music file is selected and played the user is able to perform the following operations:
<ul>
<li> Pause: halt the playback at the current position.
<li> Resume: continue playback at the current position.
<li> Fast forward / Rewind: move the slider or press the forward or backward buttons to move the position in the file to a position earlier or later in the track.
<li> Previous / Next track: skip to a previous or later track allowing movement forwards and backwards through the list of tracks.
<li> Looping: allows the same track to be repeatedly played.
<li> Hide: hide the application during playback. This allows other applications to be used while listening to music.
<li> Volume: adjustable while playing music. There is also an option to mute the sound.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Playback Keypad Support
</h3>
<a name="2-3"></a><p> For phones with keypads, there is a mapping of hardware keys to player actions.
During playback of a track the following mappings will be used:
<ul>
<li> Key-Up: to increase the volume.
<li> Key-Down: to decrease the volume.
<li> Key-Select: to Pause/Resume.
<li> Key-Left: if held for greater than a few hundred milliseconds, it seeks forward through the track, otherwise if it is not held it skips to and plays the next track.
<li> Key-Right: if held, the player seeks backwards through the track, else if the button is tapped it plays the previous track.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Playback Status
</h3>
<a name="2-4"></a><p> When a music file is played the following information is displayed (if available):
<ul>
<li> The name of the track
<li> Track duration
<li> Current position in the track
</ul>
