<p> <h2> Introduction
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> Qtopia depends on Qt/Embedded. There are two types of third-party software in Qt/Embedded -
<ol type=1>
<li> Software compiled as part of the Qt library itself - <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/licensing.html">Qt Licenses</a>
<li> Independent packages that may be added to enhance the capabilities of Qt - <a href="3rdparty.html">3rd Party Qt Licenses</a>
</ol>
<p> There are two basic categories of Qtopia licenses: commercial lincenses, and GPL-related licenses.
<p> <h2> Commercial Licenses
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> The Qtopia commercial licenses are divided according to the package of which they are a part.
See also <a href="qtopia-packages.html">Qtopia Packages.</a>

<p> <h3> Qtopia SDK Professional
</h3>
<a name="2-3"></a><p> The Qtopia SDK Professional is targetted at professional medium to large companies that carry out commercial Qtopia application development and who require the platform source code and full support and maintenance.
The Commercial development SDK license enables developers to build commercial Qtopia applications for sale or free distribution. Commercial development SDK license holders are not required to pay runtime license fees.
The Qtopia SDK Light comes with a Qt Duo pack (Qt/Embedded + Qt/Windows, Qt/Mac, or Qt/X11), the Qtopia library source as well as twelve months of support and maintenance. It is intended for professional companies that develop software for Qt/Embedded and/or Qtopia.
<p> <h3> Qtopia Runtime License
</h3>
<a name="2-4"></a><p> To distribute Qtopia on consumer electronic devices you need to purchase Qtopia Runtime Licenses. You need one runtime license per devices. The cost per license depends on the number of runtime licenses purchased and the type of Qtopia product.
A flexible target volume pricing is offered. The customer must commit to a minimum of 20% of the target volume.
<p> <h2> GPL Licenses
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> The Qtopia GPL SDK development license is free to download and use, provided applications are developed and released under the terms of the GNU GPL. It is available on our <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/download/qtopia/index.html">Qtopia downloads</a> page.
The complete GNU General Public License is available <a href="gpl.html">here.</a>
Other links:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">The GNU GPL</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">The GNU GPL FAQ</a>
</ul>
<p> <h3> Restrictions
</h3>
<a name="3-1"></a><p> You may not distribute the Qtopia Libraries or applications in any form without runtime licenses.
<p> You may not use the Qtopia GPL SDK Development License to build non-GPL software. All GPL Qtopia applications are governed by all of the terms of the GPL.
<p> <h2> Other License Issues
</h2>
<a name="4"></a><p> Qtopia itself also includes two other types of software.
Trolltech original software licensed under:
<ol type=1>
<li> a full commercial license to commercial customers
(Commercial Licensed Software).
<li> the GNU General Public License, and additionally under
a full commercial license to commercial customers
(Dual Licensed Software).
</ol>
<p> Third-party software licensed under:
<ol type=1>
<li> the GNU General Public License (GPL Licensed Software).
<li> the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL Licensed Software).
<li> liberal licenses (Very Free Software).
</ol>
<p> For more information about Qtopia third party lincensing see <a href="qtopia-3rdparty-licensing.html">Qtopia - Non-Trolltech licensed software</a>.
<p> <h2> Modifications
</h2>
<a name="5"></a><p> Note that if modifications are made to:
<ul>
<li> Dual Licensed Software, this may effect
your right to redistribute GPL Licensed Software that links with the
Dual Licensed Software, unless the modifications are made available
under the terms of the GPL.
<li> GPL Licensed Software, your right to redistribute
that software is under the terms of the GPL.
<li> LGPL Licensed Software, your right to redistribute
that software is under the terms of the LGPL.
<li> Very Free Software there are generally no constraints imposed upon redistribution.
</ul>
<p> A specific example case of Dual Licensed Software is the Media Player. The Media Player
normally links with GPL Licensed Software such as the libmpeg3 plug-in, and therefore
if you make modifications
to the Media Player, you must either make those modifications under the
terms of the GPL, or you must not distribute the GPL Licensed Software that
links with the Media Player, such as the libmpeg3 plug-in.
<p> This document is merely a guide. Full details of licensing is given in
the license documents.
