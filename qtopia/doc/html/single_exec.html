<p> <h2> Introduction
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> Qtopia can be compiled in a number of ways. The two most common ways are:
<ol type=1>
<li> standard compile - which is a fully dynamic
build where each application is a separate binary run as a separate process.
<li> single-exec compile - <tt>qpe</tt> and all the applications are linked
together in to a single large binary, however applications are still run as
separate processes.
</ol>
<p> <h2> Benefits
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> There are a number of benefits to single-exec as follows:
<ul>
<li> single large binary, is smaller in size than many separate application binaries
<li> launch times are faster when the libraries are all statically linked together with the applications.
</ul>
<p> <h2> Explanation
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> The main idea behind single-exec is to make it possible to statically link the
libraries to the programs. Normally if you did this, the size would be massive,
each application having a copy of all the libraries. But by compiling all the application
code in to a single binary, this is not a problem. Normally if one did this, you
might just have one process, and in that process create new top level widgets of
the different applications within that process, but this is not a very stable
model, a single application fault brings down the whole system. Therefore it
is necessary to run the applications as separate processes.
<p> <h2> How it works
</h2>
<a name="4"></a><p> When an application is started in single-exec, we fork the server process, and execute the same
binary again, but with an <tt>argv</tt> list that will inform the newly created process
what application it should be. This model is very similar to that used by
a UNIX tool called <em>busybox</em> which morphs in to different programs based on <tt>argv[0]</tt>.
<p> The size benefit of single-exec comes from static linking. When the linker
combines together the code, it performs various size optimizations such as:
<ul>
<li> removing inline functions that are always included inline 
<li> removing redundant or dead code that is not used by any of the application 
<li> not including symbol tables usually needed for dynamic linking.
<li> no requirement for the code to be  position independent code (PIC) which provides additional size and speed advantages.
</ul>
<p> <h2> Issues 
</h2>
<a name="5"></a><p> One important thing to be aware of when building single-exec with additional
3rd party components is that the symbols must not clash with those from other
applications, use of C++ namespaces would be a very good idea to avoid
potential problems caused by this.
<p> <h2> Building single-exec
</h2>
<a name="6"></a><p> To build Qtopia as a single-exec binary:
<ul>
<li>  configure and build Qtopia adding <tt>-singleexec</tt> to the options passed to the Qtopia <tt>configure</tt> script.
</ul>
The result is that no application binaries or plug-ins will be generated. Instead, the <tt>qpe</tt> binary will be larger but will contain all the code that would have
been in the other binaries.
