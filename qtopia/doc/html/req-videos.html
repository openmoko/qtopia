<p> The <b>Video</b> application manages and plays various types of video files.
The available files are listed using the Qtopia document model.
The videos are categorized and information about the files is displayed.
<p> <h2> Features
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> <h3> Supported Formats
</h3>
<a name="1-1"></a><p> <b>Videos</b> supports a range of video formats including:
<ul>
<li> MPEG-1
<li> MPEG-2
<li> MPEG-4
</ul>
<p> <h3> Scanning for Video Documents
</h3>
<a name="1-2"></a><p> Video files are searched for in the following locations:
<ul>
<li> Directories returned by <a href="qpeapplication.html#documentDir">QPEApplication::documentDir</a>()
<li> All mounted file systems returned by Storage::fileSystems() where the
file system is for a removable media device (for example SD cards, CF cards)
</ul>
<p> As files are found, they can be filtered and listed according to
the user's selection of a category.
<p> Re-scanning takes place when the program is notified of document changes.
Events that cause an update of the listed files are:
<ul>
<li> Another application or process changes a property of an existing document.
<li> A document is added or removed.
<li> A removable storage card is inserted or removed and the corresponding
filesystem is mounted or unmounted.
</ul>
<p> <h2> Video Documents List
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> <ul>
<li> Sort - the list of video files can be alphabetically sorted.
<li> Up/Down - the displayed list can be re-ordered by the user.
<li> Category - files in the list can be added to a Category.
<li> Add to Category - categories can be used to sort videos
into different collections in order to create virtual playlists.
<li> Users can therefore add files to a category as well as switch to
different category views.
<li> Properties - individual video properties can be displayed and edited, including:
<ul>
<li> The document name
<li> Category associations
</ul>
<li> The media codec information, including codec, bitrate and so on, can be displayed.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Playing Video Files
</h3>
<a name="2-1"></a><p> When a video file is selected from the list for playing,
the appropriate decoder plugin is found and initialized with the file to be played. The
application then displays the user interface in order to provide user control of the file's playback.
<p> Different decoder plugins can be installed in the system and detected by the player.
Video files are also played when selected
from the documents list of the <b>Qtopia Launcher</b>. When launched from the documents
list the player user interface is immediately displayed and the scanning for documents is avoided.
<p> <h3> Playback Options
</h3>
<a name="2-2"></a><p> When a video file is selected and played the user is able to perform the following
operations:
<ul>
<li> Pause - halt the playback at the current position.
<li> Resume - continue playback from the current position.
<li> Fast forward / Rewind - move the slider or press the forward or backward buttons
to move the position in the file to a position earlier or later in the video.
<li> Previous / Next video - to skip to a previous or later video allowing movement
forwards and backwards through the video list.
<li> Looping - allows the same video to be played once or repeatedly (until stopped).
<li> Fullscreen - the video can be displayed in fullscreen mode either by tapping
or clicking on the video pane, or as an option in a menu.
<li> Volume - the volume can be adjusted while the video is playing.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Playback Keypad Support
</h3>
<a name="2-3"></a><p> For keypad phones hardware keys are mapped to player actions. During playback of a video the following mappings are used:
<ul>
<li> Key-Up - increases the volume of the video.
<li> Key-Down - decreases the volume of the video.
<li> Key-Select - Pause/Resume play of the video.
<li> Key-Left - if held for greater that a few hundred milliseconds, the player seeks forward
through the video, otherwise it plays the next video.
<li> Key-Right - if held for greater that a few hundred milliseconds, the player seeks backwards through the video, else it plays the previous video.
</ul>
<p> <h3> Playback Status
</h3>
<a name="2-4"></a><p> When a video file is played the following information, if available, is displayed:
<ul>
<li> Video duration
<li> Current position in the video
</ul>
