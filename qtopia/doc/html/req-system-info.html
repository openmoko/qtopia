<p> <b>System Info</b> is a Qtopia application. It displays system information
about the device such as how much space is left and the software version.
<p> <h2> Features
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> This application is a reporting tool and gathers system information
from the device for presentation to the user. <b>System Info</b> provides
the user with accurate information to determine if it is necessary
to carry out maintenance on the device such as removing unwanted
files or arranging for a firmware upgrade.
<p> As well as the provision for selecting among the different
information tabs, <b>System Info</b> gives the user the option of running the
Clean-up Wizard enabling removal of unwanted files to recover space.
<p> <h3> Software Information
</h3>
<a name="1-1"></a><p> The "Version" tab displays information about the firmware/software
on the device: this includes the Qtopia name and icon accompanied
by the current software version number and copyright statement. If
updated Qtopia firmware is available to suit the device an
upgrade may be appropriate.
<p> <h3> System Information
</h3>
<a name="1-2"></a><p> After "Version" three other tabs - "Storage", "Memory" and "Data"
- present information about resource usage on the device.
<p> <h4> Storage 
</h4>
<a name="1-2-1"></a><p> <ul>
<li> The "Storage" tab displays the current state of non-volatile storage
devices (such as compact flash cards).
<li> A separate bar graph shows how much of each device is being used (ie a
unit fitted with two storage devices will have two bar graphs).  
<li> At the bottom of the tab there is a button for starting the Clean-up Wizard.
</ul>
<p> <h4> Clean-up Wizard
</h4>
<a name="1-2-2"></a><p> The Clean-up Wizard is invoked by clicking the button at the bottom
of the "Storage" tab.  Items for clean-up are broken into 3 catetories
and a sequence of pages is displayed to the user depending on which
categories the user selects.  If any items are chosen for clean-up
then the wizard will delete those items and report on recovered space.
<p> At each page in the sequence a "Next" button is available once the
page has been completed. Selecting the "Next" button displays
the next page in the sequence, as listed below.
<p> The pages in the Clean-up Wizard are:
<p> <ul>
<li> <b>Page 1 What items would you like to clean-up?</b> A choice
of Documents, Messages and Events is offered. The user may select
any or all of these for clean-up.
<li> <b>Page 2 clean-up Documents:</b>. If Documents was chosen on Page 1,
then this page is displayed. It allows the user to specify the minimum size 
and category of documents that will be selected for clean-up. Clicking
the "OK" button commits the size and category choices made and allows
moving forward to the documents found page.
<li> <b>Page 3 Documents found:</b> this page lists details of how many
documents were found and the space that can be recovered by deleting
them. A "Details" button takes the user to a checklist page.
<li> <b>Page 4 Uncheck Documents:</b> this page provides a checklist
that initially lists as checked all items available for clean-up
(deletion).  They may be unchecked to preserve them from being
cleaned-up.
<li> <b>Dialog: Warning:</b> If items were checked in the previous screen
then the user is allowed the opportunity to back out by selecting
"No". Selecting "Yes" permits the system to go ahead and delete
the items.
<li> <b>Dialog: Deleting items:</b> A progress bar shows the deletion
of items being completed.
<li> <b>Page 5 clean-up Messages:</b> If Messages was chosen on
Page 1 then this page is displayed. On this page the user may set
parameters by which to search for messages (emails) to clean-up. The
user may minimum size and use a date picker to select an "older than"
date to by which to filter.
<li> <b>Dialog: Warning:</b> A warning for Messages is displayed as
per the Documents warning above.
<li> <b>Dialog: Deleting items:</b> A progress dialog is displayed as above.
<li> <b>Page 6 clean-up Events:</b> If Events was chosen on Page 1 then
this page is displayed. On this page the user may set parameters to
search for events (from the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>) to clean-up. A date picker is
available to allow the user to select an "older than" date by which
to filter.
<li> <b>Dialog: Warning:</b> A warning for Events is displayed as
per the Documents warning above.
<li> <b>Dialog: Deleting items:</b> A progress dialog is displayed as above.
<li> <b>Page 7 Items deleted:</b> A final page summarising the item
deletions with a count of items removed is displayed.
</ul>
<p> <h4> Memory
</h4>
<a name="1-2-3"></a><p> <ul>
<li> The "Memory" tab contains a bar graph showing how much memory is
currently being used to run the device and its applications.
</ul>
<p> <h4> Data
</h4>
<a name="1-2-4"></a><p> <ul>
<li> The "Data" tab shows 5 different types of files and the amount of
space each type is using (in kilobytes or megabytes).
<li> The file types presented are: audio, images, mail, text and video.
A bar indicator with a color for each file type is used to show the
share of storage each is using. Another color denotes free space.
</ul>
<p> Note that if one file type is using a sufficiently large share then
the other colors may not show and the bar may be all one color.
For example if Free space is greater than 95% a solid purple bar
will show.
