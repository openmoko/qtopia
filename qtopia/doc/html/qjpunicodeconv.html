</table><h1 align=center>QJpUnicodeConv Class Reference</h1>

<p>The QJpUnicodeConv class provides implementation support for
QJisCodec, QSjisCodec, and QEucJpCodec.

<hr><a name="details"></a><h2>Detailed Description</h2>
 
<p> The QJpUnicodeConv class provides implementation support for
<a href="qjiscodec.html">QJisCodec</a>, <a href="qsjiscodec.html">QSjisCodec</a>, and <a href="qeucjpcodec.html">QEucJpCodec</a>.
<p> 
<p> You should not need to use this class directly.  If you do, keep in
mind that the function names will change in Qt 3.0: Every function
name will get a lower-case first letter: Jisx0212ToUnicode becomes
jisx0212ToUnicode, and so on.  We apologize for the upheaval.
<p> The environment variable <tt>UNICODEMAP_JP</tt> can be used to fine-tune how
QJpUnicodeConv, QEucJpCodec, QJisCodec and QSjisCodec do their work.
The mapping names are as for the Japanese XML working group's <a
href="http://www.y-adagio.com/public/standards/tr_xml_jpf/toc.htm">
XML Japanese Profile</a>, as it names and explains all the widely
used mappings. Here are brief descriptions, written by Serika
Kurusugawa: <ul>
<li> "unicode-0.9" or "unicode-0201" for Unicode style. This assume
JISX0201 for 0x00-0x7f. (0.9 is a table version of jisx02xx mapping
used for Uniocde spec version 1.1)
<li> "unicode-ascii" This assume US-ASCII for 0x00-0x7f, and some
chars (JISX0208 0x2140 and JISX0212 0x2237) are different from
Unicode 1.1 to avoid conflict.
<li> "open-19970715-0201" ("open-0201" for convenience) or
"jisx0221-1995" for JISX0221-JISX0201 style. JIS X 0221 is JIS
version of Unicode, but a few chars (0x5c, 0x7e, 0x2140, 0x216f,
0x2131) are different from Unicode 1.1. This is used when 0x5c is
treated as YEN SIGN.
<li> "open-19970715-ascii" ("open-ascii" for convenience) for
JISX0221-ASCII style. This is used when 0x5c is treated as REVERSE
SOLIDUS.
<li> "open-19970715-ms" ("open-ms" for convenience) or "cp932" for
Microsoft Windows style. Windows Code Page 932. Some chars (0x2140,
0x2141, 0x2142, 0x215d, 0x2171, 0x2172) are different from Unicode
1.1.
<li> "jdk1.1.7" for Sun's JDK style Same as Unicode 1.1, except that
JIS 0x2140 is mapped to UFF3C. Either ASCII or JISX0201 can be used
for 0x00-0x7f.
<p> </ul> In addition, QJpUnicodeConv supports some extensions:
"nec-vdc", "ibm-vdc" or "udc".
<p> For example, if you want to use Unicode style conversion, but with
NEC's extension, set <tt>UNICODEMAP_JP</tt> to
<nobr><code>unicode-0.9, nec-vdc</code>.</nobr> (You will probably
need to quote that in the shell command.)
