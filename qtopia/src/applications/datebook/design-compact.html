<h1>Design for more compact Calendar</h1>
<p>
An identified problem is that while it is very desirable
that contacts support a diverse range of fields, our
presentation of these fields sucks.

<p>
By improving the order of the fields, we can reduce the
time it takes to input a typical event. The order of
importance is:

<ol>
 <li>Description
 <li>AllDay? (affects Start, End and Alarm so must preceed them)
 <li>Start
 <li>End
 <li>Alarm
 <li>Repeat (dialog includes EndDate)
 <li>Category
</ol>

The Location of the event should be either parsed out
of the Description or otherwise set via the context menu
(see the Multi-field widget
described in the <a href=../addressbook/design-compact.html>
Contacts compaction design</a>).

<p>
The AllDay flag should probably default to TRUE when a default time is
not known (wg. the day is picked from the Month view).
