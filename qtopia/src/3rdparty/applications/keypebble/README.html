          <h3><a name="whatiskvnc">What is Keystone?</a></h3>
          <p>Keystone is a tool for <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> that
            allows you to remotely access the desktops of machines using the cross-platform
            VNC system. Keystone can access machines running a variety of operating
            systems (including most UNIX systems and Windows 95/98/NT/2000) providing
            they are running a VNC server. Note that Keystone is only a client
            program, you will need to download a server separately in order to
            use it.</p>
          <p>The protocol used by Keystone (called RFB) was developed, and released
            as GPL by ORL (now the UK branch of AT&amp;T research), they also
            wrote and maintain GPL servers for several platforms. You can find
            both information about the protocol and links to servers for a range
            of platforms on their <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">website</a>.</p>
          <p>Keystone started life as a port of Markus Wuebben's kvncviewer program
            to KDE 2, but in the course porting the code, I have rewritten and
            redesigned most of the system. The new implementation builds on several
            new facilities that were not available in KDE 1, such as KPixmapIO
            and QSocket. There is so little of the original code left that I have
            decided on a name change, and to put the version number back to 0.1.</p>
          <p>You can see a few screenshots of <a href="http://www.ipso-facto.demon.co.uk/keystone/screenshots.html">Keystone
            in action</a> on my screenshots page. The screenshots may or may not
            reflect the look of the current version as I have some look and feel
            improvements planned.</p>
          <h3><a name="servers">Servers</a></h3>
          <p>Most Linux distributions include the standard Xvnc server (usually
            run via the <i>vncserver</i> script), you can also download this and
            servers for other platforms such as MS Windows from the <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">VNC
            website</a>. If you have a problem with setting up a server then you
            should read the <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/faq.html">VNC
            FAQ</a>, and if that does not help join the VNC mailing list. Do not
            mail me on this topic - I can't help and won't even reply.</p>
          <p>I may in future write a server that operates in the same manner as
            the Win32 server for KDE. The Win32 server differs from the X11 server
            in that it does not virtualise the entire desktop. This has both advantages
            and disadvatages, it means that you can make an existing session available
            over the network, but only allows you to run a single server. I may
            also put a GUI together that makes it easy to configure the ORL server.</p>
          <h3><a name="status">Status</a></h3>
          <p><font color="#000000">The current version is 0.4, and the following

          </ul>
          <h3><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h3>
          <p>Version 0.4 contains the following known bugs:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Custom about dialog is not shown</b><br>
            I can't see a clean way to fix this without creating a complete custom
            help menu. For now I've left the standard about dialog in place.
            </li>
            <li><b>Crash when you connect to a non-existant server</b><br>
            I can reproduce this every time, but I can't figure out what's wrong
            other developers have reported similar problems and they seem to be
            down to QSocket. The only known fix so far is to use KSocket instead.
            I'd prefer to fix the problem at the source, but I'm having no luck and
            I suspect QSocket may also be causing some other weird network issues
            I've seen, so if I can't track down the bug soon I'll give in and switch
            to KSocket like everyone else.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3><a name="download"></a>Download</h3>
          <p>Keystone is available in the kdenetwork module of the
          <a href="http://www.kde.org/anoncvs.html">KDE CVS</a>, and
            is included in the KDE 2.0 release. The current version is 0.4.
            Note that Keystone <b>requires KDE 2</b>, you cannot use KDE 1.x.</p>
          <h3><a name="faq"></a>FAQs</h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Why don't the shortcut keys work in full screen mode?</b><br>
              When you're in full screen mode Keystone grabs the keyboard to send
              every key press to the remote screen. This means that you can send key
              combinations that are used by Keystone or KDE to the remote screen. If
              you really hate it, then you can add -nograb to the command line
              arguments to disable all keyboard grabs. I will add an option to allow
              this behaviour to be overridden in a future release.
            </li>
            <li><b>Why is Keystone so slow?</b><br>
              Currently only the simplest of the RFB encodings are supported, this
              means that Keystone is only useful on fairly fast networks. This is
              a serious bug and is being addressed.
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3><a name="todo">Todo</a></h3>
          These are the things I'm hoping to add to future versions of Keystone.
          They're vaguely sorted in order of importance.
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>RRE encoding.<br>
             I've started this, but the implementation has some
              bugs so it did not make the cut for Keystone 0.3.</li>
            <li>CoRRE and Hextile encodings</li>
            <li>Session management</li>
            <li>Support for Windows Terminal Server.<br>
            There is now a GPL implementation
            of the protocol, and the author is happy for me to use the code. If someone
            can offer me an account to test it on then this is possible.</li>
            <li>Zoom support.<br>
             This will be handled using the same protocol extension
              as is used in the Palm client, this will allow you to make use of
              server side scaling to reduce the amount of network traffic. You
              will also be able to do client side zooms, but in this case the
              full screen needs to transmitted over the network.</li>
            <li>Macros</li>
            <li>Monitor mode (thumbnails of several machines)</li>
            <li>ZLib extension support</li>
            <li>Bookmarks</li>
            <li>URL specific settings</li>
            <li>Possibly a DnD extension using a mechanism based on mulitpart
              MIME attachments.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Credits<a name="credits"></a></h3>
          <p>Keystone owes a lot to Markus Wuebben's kvncviewer which some of
            the code is derived from. Thanks are also due to Espen Sand the author
            of khexedit from which I borrowed some code for the about dialog.
            Alison Burch drew the bridge image used in the background of this
            page (and in future versions of Keystone too of course). Finally thanks
            go to ORL for making the RFB protocol and servers GPL.</p>
