KPhone 4.1.1                           http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/

----------------------------------------------------------------------

KPhone is a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) user agent for Linux, with
which you can initiate VoIP (Voice over IP) connections over the Internet,
send Instant Messages and subscribe your friends' presence information.

KPhone requires various programming libraries and header files (Qt, OpenSSL
et al) to be present in the system. KPhone has been somewhat tested on most
of todays Linux distributions. Requirements with each distribution vary
according to distributions' installation layout.

KPhone has been tested with a multitude of SIP proxies.

The original KPhone was written by Billy Biggs, current version by Pekka
Raisio, Jouni Vuorela and Juha Heinanen at Wirlab with suggestions and
fixes from the KPhone community around the world.

This software package comes with NO warranty. You should note that by
downloading, compling and installing it you agree to full self
responsibility.
