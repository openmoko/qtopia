Please note, the files in this directory are a little different to what you
would normally find. The "proper" arrangement is to have a .pem file and a .0
file that is a symlink to the .pem file. However, it is not desirable to have
symlinks in the Qtopia source package, the .pem files are not used directly
by openssl and Qtopia can't assume you have the command that generates .0
names for .pem files. For this reason, the .pem files do not exist and their
contents have been placed directly into .0 files.

This part is really important so I'll say it loud...
IF THE CONTENTS OF THESE FILES CHANGES THEIR NAMES MUST ALSO CHANGE.
