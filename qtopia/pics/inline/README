Images here are converted to "inlinepics_p.h" and included in the libqpe, so they
load much faster, and can be shared by multiple applications. Since the inlined pics are rarely
changed, the file is checked into p4.

To create a new inlinepics header file, you must run the qembed application from the qt/3.x tree. 
Assuming qembed is in your path, the following command should work:

p4 edit $QPEDIR/src/libraries/qtopia/inlinepics_p.h
qembed --images $QPEDIR/pics/inline/*.* > $QPEDIR/src/libraries/qtopia/inlinepics_p.h
