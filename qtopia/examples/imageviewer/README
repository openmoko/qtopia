This example demonstrates how to read in and display images, and the
conversion facilities available. The CuteWidget can read a file into
a pixmap and resizes the displayed pixmap when the widget is resized.

Note that the function CuteWidget::paintEvent uses the drawPixmap function
of QPainter to display the pixmap, the bitBlt function can also be used to
display pixmaps.

If you have installed the Qt imageio extension (see extensions/imageio
in your Qt directory), you can build using that extension.

Some of the conversion options will have no effect, depending on the
display hardware used.  Generally, these are disabled.


Note that files fileopen.png, fullscreen.png, repeat.png and rotate90.png need to be installed into $QPEDIR/pics/showimage/ : eg
    mkdir $QPEDIR/pics/showimage
    cp fileopen.png fullscreen.png repeat.png rotate90.png $QPEDIR/pics/showimage
