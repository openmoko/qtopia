<h3>Deleted Words</h3>
<p>Deleted words are those that you want removed from the dictionary,
i.e. Qtopia should never accept/suggest that word.</p>
<p>To delete a word, look it up in the vocabulary, then
%%PHONE%%
select Delete from the menu.
@@PHONE@@
%%PDA%%
press <img src=trash>.

</p>
<p>When words in the system dictionary are deleted, they are just <i>marked</i>
as delete, so you
can review and edit the list of deleted words if you change your mind. Words you
add yourself disappear once deleted.</p>
