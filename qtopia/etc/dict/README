The wordlists here are:

words-en    = /usr/dict/words on a Linux machine
words-en_GB = test file (handful of British Englih words)
words-de    = igerman98-20000206 (German ispell), excluding zusammen.txt
words-no    = ispell-norsk-1.1a (Norwegian ispell)
words-fr    = ispell-francais-IREQ (French ispell)
words-es    = sample Spanish words
words-hu    = sample Hungarian words
words-it    = sample Italian words

The "dawg" form of each is automatically generated from the "words" form.
Note that this takes a LOT of memory. Don't try it on an iPAQ, etc.
