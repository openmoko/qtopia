    \class QFutureSignal

    \brief The QFutureSignal class intercepts signals so that they can be inspected in the future.
    \ingroup qtuitest
    \ingroup qtuitest_unittest

    Testing objects that emit signals in unit tests can be difficult.
    The QSignalSpy class helps, but it cannot catch signals that happen
    upon the next entry to the event loop.

    To catch signals upon the next entry to the event loop, a slot needs
    to be created that is connected to the signal.  And then the unit
    test needs to somehow wait, processing events, until either the
    signal happens or there is a timeout.  This can lead to unit tests
    containing many "signal occurred" flags and calls to QTest::qWait().

    The QFutureSignal class simplifies unit tests that involve signals
    by combining the behavior of QSignalSpy with a nested event loop.

    The following example demonstrates how to catch a \c{changed()} signal
    on \c{obj} with a 3 second timeout:

    \code
    QFutureSignal fs(obj, SIGNAL(changed());
    ...
    QVERIFY(fs.wait(3000));
    \endcode

    If the signal occurs before the call to wait(), it will return true
    immediately, and the test will succeed.  If the signal does not occur
    before the call to wait(), it will enter a nested event loop until
    either the signal occurs, or the timeout expires.  The wait()
    function will return false on timeout, failing the test case.

    If the signal has a value associated with it, it can be checked
    using results():

    \code
    QFutureSignal fs(obj, SIGNAL(valueChanged(int));
    ...
    QVERIFY(fs.wait(3000));
    QCOMPARE(fs.resultCount(), 1);
    QCOMPARE(fs.results()[0][0].toInt(), 26);
    \endcode

    The above can be simplified using the expect() convenience function:

    \code
    QFutureSignal fs(obj, SIGNAL(stateChanged(bool));
    ...
    QVERIFY(fs.expect(3000, 26));
    \endcode

    The expect() function checks that the signal is emitted exactly one
    time, whereas wait() will be satisfied with one or more emits.
    For a signal with no arguments, the following can be done:

    \code
    QFutureSignal fs(obj, SIGNAL(changed());
    ...
    QVERIFY(fs.expect(3000));
    \endcode

    If the signal will always happen upon the next entry to the event loop,
    then it is possible to create a QFutureSignal object and wait() or expect()
    on it using a single line of code:

    \code
    QVERIFY(QFutureSignal::wait(obj, SIGNAL(changed()), 3000));
    QVERIFY(QFutureSignal::expect(obj, SIGNAL(valueChanged(int)), 3000, 26));
    \endcode

    Doing this is very risky if the signal might occur before the
    wait() or expect() call.  This simplified style should only be used
    when the programmer knows for sure that the signal will happen
    upon the next entry to the event loop.

    the specified timeout.  If \a timeout is less than zero, then this
    function will wait forever for the signal.

    The \a expectedCount parameter indicates the number of signal emissions
    we expect before wait() returns.  Normally this is 1.

    if (d->eventLoop)
